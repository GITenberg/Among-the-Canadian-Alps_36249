  <p><span class="dcap">W</span>HAT is the peculiar charm of that
  mighty, snow-capped sea of mountains, whose stupendous waves
  tossed far into the heavens seem ever about to overwhelm the
  level wheat-fields of Western Canada? The lure of the mountains
  defies analysis, but it is surely there with its irresistible
  appeal to all in whom the spirit of romance is not quite dead. It
  stirs the blood strangely when, far out on the plains of Alberta,
  you get your first glimpse of the Canadian Alps&mdash;a line of
  white, glittering peaks just above the horizon, infinitely remote
  and ethereal, something altogether apart from the prosaic world
  about you of grain and cattle, neat farm-house and unsightly
  elevator.</p>

  <p>As you follow the course of the sun, the peaks loom gradually
  up into the sky and dominate the scene, but still retain the
  atmosphere of another world. The rolling foothills in the
  foreground, like spent waves from the storm-tossed sea, seem
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg
  14]</a></span> tangible and comprehensible, but beyond and above
  the dark ramparts of the outer range, the towering outer wave of
  the mountains, float silvery outlines that seem to be the fabric
  of some other and purer world. Doubt may come with the
  marvellously clear and hardening light of the western day, but at
  sunrise, and peculiarly at sunset, the last shreds of uncertainty
  are swept away. Not of this earth is that dream of fairyland
  poised mysteriously in the upper air, glowing in exquisite tints,
  soft as a summer cloud; a realm of the spirit to which one might
  hope to journey over the path of a rainbow.</p>

  <p>One who has seen this vision may not resist the insistent call
  to explore the mountain world, to discover what lies beyond the
  frowning battlements that guard this other realm. The call has
  been working in the hearts of men for generations. They came
  alone in the early days, each man fighting his way up through
  some doorway that led into the heart of the Glittering Mountains.
  Only the stout of heart might then win through, for this
  Wonderland was guarded close on every side. Pitfalls awaited the
  unwary. The explorer must cut his own trail through the
  wilderness, cross icy torrents, climb alpine passes, find a way
  through networks of fallen timber, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span> face perils and
  discomforts every hour of the day. And yet there was something
  alluring, something that drew him on, and brought him back again
  to these high fastnesses; something that he could not understand,
  but that was none the less imperative. That same spell is as
  potent to-day, but most of the barriers are down, and where once
  men came singly or in twos and threes, paying heavily in labour
  and peril for the joys they found in the mountains, thousands now
  follow at just enough cost to themselves to give spice to the
  experience.</p>

  <p>The history of the Canadian Alps, so far as White Men have had
  anything to do with it, dates back to the closing years of the
  French R&eacute;gime in Canada. It is characteristic of the race
  that gave to the world such heroic figures as those of Champlain
  and La Salle and La V&eacute;rendrye, that while the infamous
  Bigot and the egotistical and brainless Vaudreuil were gambling
  away an empire in the New World, tireless and unselfish explorers
  were carrying the boundaries of that empire far out toward the
  setting sun.</p>

  <p>It was in the year 1751 that the Chevalier de Niverville, with
  a small party of French <i>voyageurs</i>, pushed his way up the
  muddy waters <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id=
  "Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span> of the Saskatchewan, and built Fort
  Lajonqui&egrave;re in the foothills of the Rocky Mountains.
  Niverville was not the discoverer of the mighty range that runs
  like a backbone throughout the length of North America. He had
  been anticipated some years before by a fellow-countryman, La
  V&eacute;rendrye, son of the patriotic explorer who had devoted
  his life to western discovery for the glory of his native land.
  Niverville, however, was the first White Man to look upon that
  portion of the mountains now known as the Canadian Rockies.</p>

  <p>One wonders what his impressions were as he gazed out to the
  westward over that bewildering scene. As a Canadian officer he
  had served in the expeditions against the New England Colonies,
  and was therefore familiar with the mountains of New Hampshire
  and Vermont, as well as with his own Laurentian Hills, but what
  preparation were these for such awe-inspiring majesty? Range
  piled upon range to the westward, soaring up and up in vast
  towers and domes and spires, and extending north and south to the
  utmost limits of vision, they must have seemed to Niverville an
  impregnable fortification designed to bar all further progress in
  this direction.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg
  17]</a></span></p>

  <p>Niverville was not the man, however, to be daunted by even the
  most formidable natural obstacle, and he was not without evidence
  that a way might be found through the mountains to the shores of
  that Western Sea for which he and many other Canadian explorers
  had been searching, even since the days of Champlain. While at
  Fort Lajonqui&egrave;re a party of Indians visited him, from whom
  he learned that they had traded with a strange tribe whose home
  was far to the westward, beyond the great barrier, and who spoke
  of White Men that they had seen on the sea coast. Niverville no
  doubt made plans for an expedition through the mountains, but
  they came to nothing. His leader, Saint-Pierre, was having
  trouble with the Indians at his fort on the Assiniboine;
  Niverville was recalled, and before long the entire party of
  French explorers were making their way back to far-off Quebec, to
  help Montcalm in his last desperate effort to save New
  France.</p>

  <p>In 1754, and again in 1772, officers of the Hudson's Bay
  Company made journeys of exploration from York Factory, on the
  western shores of Hudson Bay, to the country of the Blackfoot
  Indians, among the foothills of the Rocky Mountains; but it was
  not until 1793 that <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id=
  "Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span> any White Man was daring enough to
  penetrate their fastnesses. In that year Alexander Mackenzie, who
  had four years earlier descended the river that bears his name,
  to the shores of the Arctic Ocean, forced his way through the
  Peace River Pass, and after suffering great hardships, stood at
  last beside the waters of the Pacific, fulfilling at last the
  dream of French explorers of an overland route to the Western
  Sea.</p>

  <p>Within the next few years discoveries followed thick and fast.
  The North West Company, the Canadian rival of the Hudson's Bay
  Company in the western fur trade, was reaching out eagerly for
  new fields to conquer, and the more adventurous of its officers,
  scouting far ahead of the main army, became more explorers than
  fur-traders. Mackenzie was himself a partner of the North West
  Company, and where he led others soon followed, breaking new
  trails through the mountains, leaving the level plains and
  comparatively sparse vegetation of the eastern side, and coming
  down into the almost tropical luxuriance of the Pacific
  slope.</p>

  <p>David Thompson, the astronomer of the North West Company, was
  the first to find a way through the mountains in the
  neighbourhood of the Kicking Horse Pass route, or the main line
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg
  19]</a></span> of the Canadian Pacific Railway. In 1800 he made
  his way over to the Columbia Valley, perhaps by what was later
  known as the Simpson Pass; and the same year Duncan McGillivray
  found a route farther north by Howse Pass, named after Jasper
  Howse, another Rocky Mountain explorer. Simon Fraser, who had
  followed Mackenzie through the Peace Pass, in 1808 explored the
  river that bears his name from the mountains to the sea,
  descending its terrific canyons in a frail canoe.</p>

  <p>At the very time that Fraser was making his way down this
  river, Thompson was exploring the Kootenay and the Columbia. Two
  years afterward the latter discovered the Athabaska Pass, which
  for many years was to remain the principal highway of the
  fur-traders back and forth through the mountains. Often enough
  the mountains above the pass must have looked down upon the
  picturesque cavalcade of traders, carrying goods over to the
  posts in New Caledonia or down the Columbia, or bringing back the
  "returns" as the cargoes of furs were called. One can picture the
  long string of pack-horses climbing up the pass, with the
  cheerful philosophy (or diabolical cunning) of the Indian cayuse,
  urged forward by fluent traders. One can see, too, at
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg
  20]</a></span> nightfall, the camp-fires in the mountains;
  horses, browsing contentedly; men lounging about waiting for
  their supper, perhaps fresh venison, or the old stand-by
  pemmican; and later, pipe and story and song&mdash;the beautiful
  old <i>chansons</i> of French Canada with their haunting
  refrains:</p>

  <p>After this initial age of exploration, most of the credit of
  which belongs to the men of the North West Company, we come to a
  period of travel. Some of the rarest and at the same time most
  interesting books of travel in Northwestern America are those
  which describe overland journeys to and from the Pacific by way
  of one or other of the famous gateways through the Canadian
  Rockies. Such a book is Gabriel Franch&egrave;re's <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
  narrative including an account of his trip through the mountains
  in 1814; another is that of Ross Cox, who with Franch&egrave;re
  was concerned in the dramatic events connected with the history
  of Astoria, of which Washington Irving wrote such an entertaining
  and thoroughly unreliable account. Ross Cox crossed the mountains
  three years after Franch&egrave;re.</p>

  <p>Another little-known narrative is that of Sir George Simpson's
  expedition of 1825. Sir George Simpson was then Governor of the
  Hudson's Bay Company, and like Jehu he drove furiously. He
  travelled in what was known as a light canoe, manned with picked
  boatmen famous for speed, skill and endurance; they were off at
  daylight or earlier, and did not camp before nightfall. In his
  journeys across the continent, by the great water routes of the
  fur-trade, the Governor's canoe bore about the same relation to
  the regular brigades that the Twentieth Century Limited does to a
  freight train.</p>

  <p>One of the most fascinating of the narratives of this period
  is Paul Kane's <i>Wanderings of an Artist among the Indians of
  North America</i>. Kane was a Toronto artist, who travelled
  across the continent studying the manners and customs of the
  various tribes, and making a series of most <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
  delightful sketches of them and of their country. His comments on
  the natives and their habits are shrewd and entertaining, and if
  written to-day would sometimes be thought much too frank for
  publication. Kane crossed the Athabaska Pass in 1846, and
  returned the same way the following year.</p>

  <p>Five or six years earlier Sir George Simpson again traversed
  the mountains, by the pass that bears his name, in the course of
  his famous journey around the world. The journeys of Father De
  Smet, the western missionary, of the Earl of Southesk, of Milton
  and Cheadle, and of William Francis Butler, to mention only a few
  of the more prominent, belong to the same general period.</p>

  <p>Butler went through the Peace River Pass, and at its eastern
  entrance climbed a steep hill known as the Buffalo's Head to get
  his first wide view of the mountains. He tried to describe what
  he saw, but admitted the futility of the attempt.</p>

  <p>"Not more wooden," he says, "are the ark animals of our
  childhood, than the words in which man would clothe the images of
  that higher nature which the Almighty has graven into the shapes
  of lonely mountains! Put down your <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> wooden woods bit by
  bit; throw in colour here, a little shade there, touch it up with
  sky and cloud, cast about it that perfume of blossom or breeze,
  and in Heaven's name what does it come to after all? Can the eye
  wander away, away, away until it is lost in blue distance as a
  lark is lost in blue heaven, but the sight still drinks the
  beauty of the landscape, though the source of the beauty be
  unseen, as the source of the music which falls from the azure
  depths of the sky.</p>

  <p>"That river coming out broad and glittering from the dark
  mountains, and vanishing into yon profound chasm with a roar
  which reaches up even here&mdash;billowy seas of peaks and
  mountains beyond number away there to south and west&mdash;that
  huge half dome which lifts itself above all others sharp and
  clear cut against the older dome of heaven! Turn east, look out
  into that plain&mdash;that endless plain where the pine-trees are
  dwarfed to speargrass and the prairie to a
  meadow-patch&mdash;what do you see? Nothing, poor blind reader,
  nothing, for the blind is leading the blind; and all this
  boundless range of river and plain, ridge and prairie, rocky
  precipice and snow-capped sierra, is as much above my poor power
  of words, as He who built this mighty nature is higher still than
  all."</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg
  24]</a></span></p>

  <p>Yet so insistent is the charm of the mountains, as he makes
  his way ever deeper into their secret recesses, that he must try
  once more to put his impressions into words:</p>

  <p>"Wonderful things to look at are these white peaks, perched up
  so high above our world. They belong to us, yet they are not of
  us. The eagle links them to the earth; the cloud carries to them
  the message of the sky; the ocean sends them her tempest; the air
  rolls her thunders beneath their brows, and launches her
  lightnings from their sides; the sun sends them his first
  greeting, and leaves them his latest kiss. Yet motionless they
  keep their crowns of snow, their glacier crests of jewels, and
  dwell among the stars heedless of time or tempest."</p>

  <p>Up to the year of 1858 travel in the Rocky Mountains was
  confined to one or other of the passes. Men did not wander off
  the beaten trails, but hurried through east or west. Between 1858
  and 1860 the members of the Palliser Expedition, and particularly
  that tireless explorer, Dr. James Hector, pushed into the very
  heart of the mountains, discovering new passes, tracing rivers to
  their sources, and for the first time giving the world some idea
  of the wonderful region of peaks, lakes and valleys that lay
  beyond the western <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id=
  "Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span> prairies. Among many other familiar
  place-names in the Canadian Rockies, that of Kicking Horse Pass
  was given by Dr. Hector, who on his first journey through the
  pass was nearly killed by a vicious horse. It has before now been
  suggested that a more appropriate name for this important route
  through the mountains would be that of the explorer himself.</p>

  <p>The task so splendidly initiated by Captain Palliser and his
  associates of exploring and mapping the Canadian Rockies was
  afterward taken up by the officers of the Canadian Geological
  Survey and the Topographical Survey of Canada, and is still in
  progress.</p>

  <p>One may round out this very brief survey of the opening up of
  the Canadian Alps, the Wonderlands of the Canadian West, by
  mentioning some recent expeditions of a group of explorers whose
  object was rather recreation than science; who saw in these
  mountains a boundless playground where tired men and women of the
  cities might find rest and pleasure, where unclimbed peaks rise
  on every side to tempt the more energetic and repay them with
  marvellous impressions of unforgettable splendour, where
  snowbound passes lead one over into green valleys holding in
  their embrace lakes of the most <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> exquisite colouring,
  where the mountain goat and the bighorn gaze down upon you from
  dizzy heights or scamper up the face of impossible precipices,
  and the silvertip lumbers off the trail with ponderous dignity,
  where the day's tramp brings endless variety of towering cliff
  and snowy summit, cathedral aisles in the prim&aelig;val forest,
  falling curtains of mist from gigantic glaciers, chaotic slopes
  of rock and alpine meadows dressed in all the colours of the
  rainbow, where the camp-fire brings perfect content and a spirit
  of comradeship unknown in the cities, where the mountain air puts
  new life into you, fills you with wholesome optimism, makes you
  realise as you never did before that the world is good, good to
  look upon and good to live upon.</p>

  <p>One need only mention the titles of some of the books in which
  these expeditions are described to suggest the spirit that
  animates them: Hornaday's <i>Camp-fires in the Canadian
  Rockies</i>, Schaffers's <i>Old Indian Trails</i>, Outram's <i>In
  the Heart of the Canadian Rockies</i>, Green's <i>Among the
  Selkirk Glaciers</i>. If we add the wonderfully-illustrated work
  of Walter D. Wilcox, and the narratives of Stutfield and Collie,
  Coleman, Baillie-Grohman, and a few others, we have a little
  library of Canadian Alpine literature that <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span> will
  be a revelation to any one who has not yet become familiar with
  the irresistible appeal of this land of pure delight.</p>

  <p>A word remains to be said, and it may as well be said here as
  elsewhere, as to routes&mdash;how to get to the Canadian National
  Parks. From Eastern Canada, and the Atlantic seaboard, probably
  the most convenient route is the direct transcontinental line of
  the Canadian Pacific Railway from Montreal, and by that route
  unquestionably the most comfortable train is the well-known
  "Imperial Limited." From Toronto, or points south of Toronto in
  the United States, the "Pacific Express" of the Canadian Pacific
  Railway offers a direct route to the Mountains. If your
  starting-point is in the Middle West, it will be well to take the
  route from Chicago to Winnipeg and join the "Imperial Limited"
  there; or the more direct line from Chicago to the main line of
  the Canadian Pacific Railway at Moosejaw. All these routes will
  bring you to the eastern portal of the mountains at Calgary, and
  on to Banff and other points in the Parks. If you are bound for
  Jasper Park in the north, any of the three transcontinental
  railways, the Grand Trunk Pacific, Canadian Pacific, or Canadian
  Northern, will take you direct <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> from Winnipeg to
  Edmonton, and you can get in to the Park by either the Grand
  Trunk Pacific or Canadian Northern.</p>

  <p>If your starting-point is on the Pacific Coast the Canadian
  Pacific Railway from Vancouver is the direct route, or you may
  join the main line from the south at several points east of
  Vancouver. By the autumn of 1914 the Grand Trunk Pacific will be
  completed to its Pacific terminus, Prince Rupert, and the
  Canadian Northern may also be ready for traffic to Vancouver
  before the end of the year. Round trips will then be possible
  taking in all the Canadian Mountain Parks: From Calgary by
  Canadian Pacific Railway to Rocky Mountain Park, Yoho Park and
  Glacier Park, and on to Vancouver. From Vancouver north by boat
  to Prince Rupert, and by Grand Trunk Pacific east to Robson Park
  and Jasper Park; or possibly direct from Vancouver by Canadian
  Northern to the same parks. From Jasper Park the return to
  Calgary would be by Edmonton and the Canadian Pacific Railway
  branch line.</p>

  <p><span class="dcap">T</span>HE last spike in the first of
  Canada's transcontinental roads, the Canadian Pacific Railway,
  was driven at Craigillachie, British Columbia, in 1885. Two years
  later, after a memorable debate in the House of Commons, an Act
  of Parliament was passed setting apart for the use and enjoyment
  of the people of the young Dominion a national park in the heart
  of the Rocky Mountains. Thus was initiated a policy which has
  since been developed upon broad and generous lines, and which
  will ultimately give Canada an unrivalled system of magnificent
  natural playgrounds.</p>

  <p>The first park, as created in 1887, covered an area of 260
  square miles, with the little station of Banff, on the Canadian
  Pacific Railway, as headquarters. In 1902 the area was enlarged
  to 5,000 square miles, but reduced again in 1911, under the terms
  of the Forest Reserves and Parks Act, to 1,800 square miles. The
  object of the reduction was apparently to confine the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg
  32]</a></span> park to an area that could be efficiently
  administered with the existing staff. It is understood, however,
  that in view of the extraordinary popularity of this wonderful
  mountain region, steps will be taken before long to re-establish
  the boundaries of 1902. The wisdom of such a move cannot be
  doubted. The increased cost of maintenance would be comparatively
  slight, and the advantages would be enormous. It would make
  accessible the exceedingly interesting country north of the
  present park boundaries with its great alpine peaks, snow-fields
  and glaciers, its beautiful valleys, lakes, mountain streams and
  waterfalls; it would help to preserve from destruction by
  vandalism or sheer carelessness many of the scenic beauties of
  the region; and would give to the wild animals of the mountains a
  further lease of life.</p>

  <p>Since the establishment of the first reservation, known
  officially as Rocky Mountains Park, and popularly as the Banff
  Park, several other similar districts have been set apart.
  Immediately west of Rocky Mountains Park, but on the British
  Columbia side of the main range, is Yoho Park, with an area of
  about 560 square miles. The boundaries of this park also will, it
  is hoped, be enlarged in the near future. West again,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg
  33]</a></span> and still following the main line of the Canadian
  Pacific Railway, we come to Glacier Park, in the Selkirk
  Mountains, with an area of 468 square miles. Farther north, on
  the main line of the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway, the Canadian
  Government has lately established Jasper Park, with an area of
  1,000 square miles. This, too, may be expanded to several times
  its present dimensions within the next few years.<a name=
  "fnanchor_1" id="fnanchor_1"></a><a href="#footnote_1" class=
  "fnanchor">[1]</a> It is possible also that a new park may be
  created between Rocky Mountain Park and Jasper Park, to embrace
  the little-known Brazeau River country and possibly the upper
  waters of the North Saskatchewan, with the great peaks that lie
  up toward the continental divide. Down near the International
  Boundary, at the extreme southwestern corner of the province of
  Alberta, is Waterton Lake Park. The present area is only sixteen
  square miles, but the Government is being strongly urged to
  extend its boundaries so as to make the reserve conterminous with
  Glacier Park on the United States side, thereby creating what
  would in effect be an international park.<a name="fnanchor_2" id=
  "fnanchor_2"></a><a href="#footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
  North again, but still in the province of Alberta, are Buffalo
  Park and Elk Island Park, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34"
  id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> the former of 160 square miles, a
  little south of Wainwright, on the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway,
  and the latter, about the same area as Waterton Lake Park, near
  Lamont, on the Canadian Northern Railway. The former is the home
  of the famous herd of buffalo, now numbering over 1,200, most of
  which were purchased by the Dominion Government in 1907 from
  Michel Don Pablo of Missoula, Montana. The latter is a
  reservation for elk, moose and other large animals.</p>

  <p>In addition to the proposed Brazeau Park, access to which
  would be provided by the Canadian Northern Railway, plans are
  being formulated for a new park west of Glacier, to include Mount
  Revelstoke and the surrounding region, and another on the Pacific
  Coast not far from the city of Vancouver, to include the country
  between the north arm of Burrard Inlet and Pitt River.</p>

  <p>The somewhat peculiar boundaries of the Canadian National
  Parks may call for a word of explanation. It will be noticed that
  on their western, or rather southwestern, sides Rocky Mountains
  and Jasper Parks stop at the continental divide, or in other
  words at the boundary <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id=
  "Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> between Alberta and British
  Columbia. The explanation is this: when British Columbia came
  into the Dominion she retained control of the public lands within
  her borders; on the other hand when the province of Alberta was
  created her land remained vested in the Dominion. Consequently
  the federal authorities may establish national parks wherever
  they will on the Alberta side of the mountains, but have no
  jurisdiction on the British Columbia side except in one
  particular region. This is a strip of land forty miles wide, or
  twenty miles on each side of the Canadian Pacific Railway main
  line, extending from the summit of the Rocky Mountains to the
  Pacific Ocean. When British Columbia entered Confederation in
  1871, one of the terms of union was that the new province should
  be given railway connection with Eastern Canada. In fulfilment of
  this agreement, the Dominion granted the Canadian Pacific Railway
  a subsidy of $25,000,000 and 25,000,000 acres of land. British
  Columbia was also to give a money subsidy to the company, but
  finding it impossible to meet its obligations the Dominion
  assumed the burden in consideration of a grant of this forty-mile
  strip across the province. It is in this strip, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
  therefore, that the Yoho and Glacier Parks have been located, as
  well as the proposed park at Burrard Inlet.</p>

  <p>The policy of the Dominion Government in administering its
  national parks is to throw them wide open to the people, to
  provide convenient means of access to every point of interest
  within their boundaries, to preserve intact their natural
  beauties and safeguard their wild life, and to grant all visitors
  the widest liberty consistent with these objects and with the
  interests of the people themselves; in fact to provide the
  maximum of convenience and protection with the minimum of
  interference. Thanks largely to the intelligence,
  broad-mindedness and genuine enthusiasm of the officials in
  charge of the Parks, from the Commissioner in Ottawa to the
  Forest Ranger on duty in some remote corner of the reservation,
  the administration has been conspicuously successful, as every
  one will admit who has had the good fortune to visit any of these
  magnificent national playgrounds.</p>

  <p>The extent to which the Parks administration is prepared to go
  in insuring the comfort and convenience of those who seek rest or
  pleasure in the mountains is admirably illustrated in the
  following extract from the Commissioner's Report:</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg
  37]</a></span></p>

  <p>"The Parks Branch policy necessarily relates to the quality of
  the service of whatever kind rendered by those dealing with the
  tourist: character of accommodation, avoidance of congestion,
  protection against extortion, provision of minor attractions to
  fill in between the nature trips, construction and maintenance of
  good roads and trails, special care in the matter of the dust
  nuisance and rough roads, supervision over sanitary conditions,
  water supply, horses and vehicles, guides, drivers, charges and
  rates, furnishing of full and reliable information, and,
  generally, the reduction of discomforts to a minimum and the
  administration of affairs so that the tourist shall be as
  satisfied with the treatment received while in the parks as he
  inevitably must be with the scenic wonders he has viewed."</p>

  <p>The accommodation of the hotels in the parks is excellent in
  every way. In spite of their out-of-the-way situation they
  provide all the comforts and luxuries of city hotels, and at very
  moderate rates. There are several good hotels at Banff in the
  Rocky Mountains Park, the best of which is the Banff Springs
  Hotel, maintained by the Canadian Pacific Railway. The railway
  company also owns the very comfortable Chalet at Lake Louise, in
  the same park, as well as the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span> hotels at Field, in
  Yoho Park, and Glacier, in Glacier Park. The Grand Trunk Pacific
  Railway has also decided to build hotels at Jasper and Miette Hot
  Springs, in Jasper Park, as well as at Grand Fork in Robson Park,
  within full view of the monarch of the Canadian Rockies, Mount
  Robson. Robson Park has recently been set apart by the Government
  of British Columbia. Its boundaries extended to the height of
  land where they run with those of Jasper Park.</p>

  <p>One of the admirable features of the administration of the
  Canadian National Parks is the leasing of lots on nominal terms,
  so that those who prefer home to hotel life may build their own
  cottages. At Banff you can obtain a lot for from $8.00 to $15.00
  a year, according to position and area. The leases run for
  forty-two years, with the privilege of renewal for an equal
  period. The same privilege may be obtained in Jasper Park.</p>

  <p>One of the principal activities of the Park administration is
  of course the building of roads and trails to the various points
  of interest, mountains, lakes, waterfalls, and so forth. The
  Canadian parks are still in their infancy from an administrative
  point of view, and an immense amount of work remains to be done
  before their innumerable <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39"
  id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span> points of beauty and grandeur are
  made conveniently accessible. Still it is possible to-day to reach
  all the principal peaks and valleys with a moderate expenditure
  of time and energy. In the four principal parks, Rocky Mountains,
  Yoho, Glacier and Jasper, there are now, 163 miles of good
  carriage road, and nearly 300 miles of trail, and this mileage
  will be largely increased within the next few years. It is the
  intention also to provide foot-paths to all the nearer points,
  with rest-houses, for those who prefer to wander about afoot.</p>

  <p>An ambitious project closely associated with the parks is the
  automobile road from Calgary to Vancouver. This is being built
  through the co-operation of the Dominion Government, the
  provincial governments of Alberta and British Columbia, and the
  Canadian Pacific Railway. Portions of the road are already
  completed, and the balance has been surveyed and the necessary
  appropriations provided. The present coach road from Calgary to
  Banff will be improved to form the first link; and the Banff to
  Laggan road will be utilised as far as Castle Mountain. Here the
  automobile road turns up Little Vermilion Creek to Vermilion
  Pass, the boundary of Rocky Mountains Park on this side. From
  Vermilion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg
  40]</a></span> Pass the road will cross the Briscoe Range by
  Sinclair Pass to Sinclair Hot Springs, and ascend the valley of
  the Columbia to Windermere Lake and the source of the Columbia.
  Crossing the spit of land that separates the Columbia from its
  mighty tributary the Kootenay, the road will follow the latter
  stream to Wardner, then turn west to Kootenay Lake and Nelson,
  cross the Columbia again after its huge bend to the north, and
  swing down to the international boundary at Grand Forks, where
  connection will no doubt be made some time with automobile roads
  from the south. From Grand Forks the road will follow a general
  westerly direction, crossing Okanagan River near Fairview,
  ascending the Similkameen, traversing the Hope Range and coming
  down the Coquihalla to Hope on the Fraser River, and descending
  the Fraser to Vancouver.</p>

  <p>An alternative route runs west from Windermere, over the Wells
  Pass, crosses the Lardo country to Killarney at the head of the
  Lower Arrow Lake, thence up Fire Valley to the present wagon road
  near Monashee Mines, follows the road to Vernon and Grand
  Prairie, and by way of Douglas Lake to Merritt and a junction
  with the route already described. The main road from Calgary to
  Vancouver will have a total <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> length of about six
  hundred miles, and will provide one of the most magnificent
  scenic routes in the world.</p>

  <p>From Grande Prairie a branch is projected to Kamloops, and
  south to Nicola. By way of Kamloops and Ashcroft, also,
  connection may eventually be made with the famous Caribou Road to
  the north country, and in the far north, the Caribou Road may be
  extended to Fort George and up the Fraser to Robson and Jasper
  Parks, bringing the traveller back to the eastern side of the
  Rockies at Edmonton. From Kamloops, again, a road may be built up
  the North Thompson to Robson Park.</p>

  <p>Another alternative route, and one that has already been
  practically decided upon, will swing east from Wardner and
  traverse the Crow's Nest Pass to the Alberta side of the
  mountains, where it will follow the foothills to Calgary. Still
  another branch of the main motor road will run from Castle
  Mountain through Rocky Mountains and Yoho Parks to Field and
  Golden, thence up the Columbia Valley to a junction with the main
  road. Portions of this branch road have already been built by the
  Dominion Government in the two parks. Apart from other
  advantages, the completion of this branch and of that portion
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg
  42]</a></span> of the main road from Castle Mountain to the
  Columbia Valley, will provide a motor road with easy grades
  through beautiful valleys and over several mountain passes,
  completely encircling the famous region of magnificent peaks,
  snow-fields, glaciers, lakes and waterfalls centring in Lake
  Louise, a region which in its combination of majesty and beauty,
  and its variety of colouring and composition, is surely without a
  peer. From the main road trails will lead inward to Consolation
  Valley, Moraine Lake and the Valley of the Ten Peaks, Paradise
  Valley, Lake O'Hara, the Ottertail Range, and a perfect galaxy of
  great peaks many of which have never yet been climbed or even
  visited.</p>

  <p>As already mentioned, the administration of the Canadian
  National Parks is designed to interfere as little as possible
  either with the natural features of the parks or with the liberty
  of those who come to enjoy their beauty. There are in fact only
  two important <span class="smcap">MUST NOTS</span> addressed to
  visitors in the Parks, and these are that they must not destroy
  trees, and that they must not kill wild animals. Even in these
  cases the policy is rather one of education than prohibition.
  People are being taught to appreciate the scenic as well as
  material value of the forest areas in the parks, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span> and
  the simple precautions that are necessary to protect these areas
  from destruction by fire; and they are also learning to protect
  rather than destroy the wild life that seeks sanctuary here. One
  suggestion only remains of police supervision. If you bring a gun
  into any of the National Parks, it is sealed as you cross the
  boundary, and severe penalties are provided for breaking the seal
  while the sportsman remains within the park.</p>

  <p>The marvellous effect of protected areas on the increase of
  wild life has been often commented upon, but the instinct which
  seems to draw all wild creatures, and particularly the more timid
  and shy animals, to these sanctuaries must always be a matter of
  interest and astonishment to visitors. To one who has watched the
  rapid increase in Rocky Mountains Park and the other reservations
  of animals which a few years ago were rarely seen, the situation
  is exceedingly gratifying. The diaries of park officers in this
  regard make interesting reading. Deer are now found everywhere in
  the park, and have become so tame that "numbers wandered into
  Banff town and remained there for days." Mountain goat are
  constantly met with along the trails, and were lately found on
  the east side of the Spray River, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> which had not occurred
  for many years. Flocks of twenty-five or more may be seen any day
  along the Banff-Laggan road. What is even more satisfactory,
  bighorn which had entirely disappeared from most parts of the
  Canadian Rockies are now increasing rapidly in the Parks. Black
  bear have become numerous, and a number of grizzlies and cubs
  have been seen, as well as red fox, wolverine, marten and lynx,
  and tracks of mountain lion. Large flocks of wild duck are
  reported on Bow Lake, as well as ruffled grouse, partridge,
  rabbits and other small game in the woods. Cinnamon bear are
  reported in Jasper Park, as well as a marked increase of
  beaver.</p>

  <p>A word or two may not be out of place as to some of the plans
  for the future of the Parks administration. The Zoo at Banff is
  to be moved to a much more suitable location on the lower slopes
  of Tunnel Mountain, and systematically developed with the object
  of making it a complete exhibition of the wild life of Western
  Canada. A special reserve is to be set apart in some suitable
  place for antelope, which do not appear to thrive in any of the
  existing parks. It is proposed to establish a protected area in
  the Fort Smith country about seven hundred miles north of
  Edmonton, for the preservation of the herd of wood
  buffalo&mdash;the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id=
  "Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> only buffalo still living in the
  wild state. This would also be used as a sanctuary for other
  animals of the northern regions. It is also proposed, following
  the very successful experiments in Alaska, to provide
  reservations for reindeer in the Yukon. Another suggestion, which
  it is earnestly hoped may be adopted, looks to the setting apart
  at various points throughout the Dominion of small sanctuaries
  for the preservation of bird life.</p>

  <p>One other plan that is being earnestly advocated by the
  progressive Commissioner of Dominion Parks will appeal with
  peculiar force to those who are labouring to bring the physical,
  mental and moral advantages of out-of-door life within reach of
  the masses of our city-dwellers. The plan is simply to bring
  National Parks to the people&mdash;a step distinctly in advance
  of the old policy of providing parks, and letting the people get
  to them if they were able. The Commissioner recognises the fact
  that the great mountain parks of Canada are for the most part
  accessible only to the comparatively well-to-do. To the majority
  of those who live in the cities the cost of the railway journey
  is of course prohibitive. He proposes, then, that the Dominion
  Government should secure a suitable tract of wild land within
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg
  46]</a></span> easy reach of each of the principal centres of
  population throughout the country, make it accessible by means of
  roads and trails, put it in charge of competent wardens, make it
  a sanctuary for the wild life of the neighbourhood, and throw it
  wide open to the people. Probably no other country is so
  favourably situated for such a measure at the present time. Wild
  land, with every variety of delightful natural scenery, may still
  be set apart or secured at no great cost within an hour or so's
  journey of most of the Canadian cities. At the same time these
  cities are growing at a phenomenal rate, and in a few years' time
  when the need of these natural playgrounds of the people will be
  much more acute than it is to-day, the cost of the land would
  probably be prohibitive. An illustration of what may be done for
  other Canadian cities is the proposed park on the British
  Columbia coast between Burrard Inlet and Pitt River. This park
  will be of great benefit to the present people of the city of
  Vancouver, but it will be of infinitely greater moment to the
  Vancouver of fifty years hence with its population of a million
  or more.</p>

  <p>It is worth while to read the debates in the Canadian House of
  Commons of a quarter of a century ago, when the first of Canada's
  National <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg
  47]</a></span> Parks was set apart for the benefit of the people
  of the Dominion, and note the practical unanimity of sentiment
  among statesmen on both sides of politics, Sir John Macdonald,
  Sir Richard Cartwright, the late Lord Strathcona, Peter Mitchell,
  and many others, most of whom have since gone beyond the reach of
  worldly problems, as to the manifold advantages of such a policy.
  Equally significant are the words of the present Governor
  General, His Royal Highness the Duke of Connaught, at a meeting
  in Ottawa in March, 1913. "I do not think," he said, "that Canada
  realises what an asset the nation possesses in the parks. These
  areas have been preserved from the vandal hand of the builder for
  the use and enjoyment of the people, who may take their holidays
  there and keep close to nature under the most comfortable
  conditions, assuring a store of health which will make them the
  better able to cope with the strenuous life to which they return
  after their vacation."</p>

  <p>Even more significant are the words of Lord Bryce, late
  ambassador to the United States: "Let us think of the future. We
  are the trustees of the future. We are not here for ourselves
  alone. All these gifts were not given to us to be used by one
  generation or with the thought of one <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
  generation only before our minds. We are the heirs of those who
  have gone before, and charged with the duty of what we owe to
  those who come after, and there is no duty which seems to be
  higher than that of handing on to them undiminished facilities
  for the enjoyment of some of the best gifts the Creator has seen
  fit to bestow upon His people."</p>

  <p><span class="dcap">B</span>ANFF is probably one of the most
  cosmopolitan communities in the world. Although its permanent
  population hardly exceeds one thousand, about 75,000 visitors
  registered during the season of 1913, coming from every
  out-of-the-way corner of the globe, Finland and Tasmania, the
  Isle of Man and the Fiji Islands, Siam, Korea and Japan, Norway,
  Egypt and the Argentine, New Zealand, Mexico, Turkey and Borneo.
  In fact, one is rather surprised to find no representative here
  from Greenland or Terra del Fuego. The bulk of these tourists of
  course come from other parts of Canada, from the United States,
  and from the United Kingdom, but practically every country in the
  world sends its quota, large or small, to this wonderful
  playground in the heart of the Canadian Rockies.</p>

  <p>To accommodate all these visitors there are several
  comfortable hotels in Banff, notably the Banff Springs Hotel, and
  the Chateau Rundle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id=
  "Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span> The Banff Springs Hotel, which has
  been repeatedly enlarged to meet the ever-increasing requirements
  of tourist traffic, stands on the summit of a rocky butte above
  the junction of the Bow and Spray Rivers, and commands a
  strikingly beautiful view to the eastward where the Bow has
  forced a passage between Tunnel Mountain and Mount Rundle. Bow
  Falls lie immediately beneath, and in the distance the Fairholme
  Range makes a splendid background.</p>

  <p>Of the large number of tourists who visit the Canadian Alps,
  the majority do not get very far away from Banff. The reason is
  perhaps not hard to seek. At Banff they find, without any
  particular effort, delightful views of mountain scenery, with all
  the comforts and luxuries of eastern pleasure resorts.
  Comparatively short carriage drives over good roads take them to
  a dozen points of interest in the immediate neighbourhood. One of
  the most popular of these is the Cave and Basin, a mile or so up
  the valley of the Bow, where one may enjoy a plunge into the
  clear green waters of the pool. Other springs, with a much higher
  temperature, boil out of the upper slope of Sulphur Mountain,
  flowing over a series of brilliantly coloured terraces into
  natural limestone pools. Here, as well as at the Basin,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg
  53]</a></span> bath-houses have been provided with every
  appliance for those who seek health or merely pleasure. The drive
  up to the springs, through the pines, and with ever-widening
  views of the enchanting valley, is well worth while for its own
  sake.</p>

  <p>A much finer view, however, is to be had from the summit of
  Tunnel Mountain. One may drive, ride, or if he prefers a little
  moderate exercise, walk to the summit. The southern face of
  Tunnel Mountain drops in a sheer precipice nearly a thousand feet
  to the valley of the Bow. Beyond rises the rugged bulk of Rundle,
  with the Goat Range in the distance, the Spray winding as a
  silver thread down the valley, the Bow sweeping down from the
  northwest, a noble circle of peaks filling the horizon to the
  northwest and north, the Vermilion Lakes sparkling in their
  emerald setting, and around to the northeast, a glimpse of Lake
  Minnewanka.</p>

  <p>With a fishing rod, and any other congenial companion, an
  enjoyable canoe trip may be had to Vermilion Lakes. The way lies
  up the Bow to Echo Creek, and by this miniature waterway to the
  lakes. As an afternoon's paddle nothing more delightful could be
  imagined, and the fishing is excellent, but the really serious
  fisherman will prefer the longer trip to Lake Minnewanka
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg
  54]</a></span> where lake trout are to be had of fighting temper
  and phenomenal size. Fourteen fish of a total weight of
  forty-three pounds represented one day's catch of a couple of
  sportsmen in this lake; sixteen caught the following day weighed
  forty-eight pounds. These, however, were pygmies beside the
  gigantic trout landed by Dr. Seward Webb in 1899, which tipped
  the scales at forty-seven pounds. To silence the incredulous,
  this monster is still preserved in a glass case at the Minnewanka
  Chalet.</p>

  <p>A drive of nine miles from Banff, skirting the base of Cascade
  Mountain, lands the traveller on the shores of Lake Minnewanka.
  On the way he may visit a herd of about 25 buffalo, and enjoy the
  view from the rustic bridge down into the Devil's Canyon. The
  lake is some sixteen miles in length, and one may explore it
  either in a boat or by chartering the launch provided by the
  Canadian Pacific Railway. It swings, in the shape of a great
  sickle, around the base of Mount Inglismaldie, whose dizzy
  precipices soar some thousands of feet into the sky, with the
  glorious pinnacles of Mount Peechee in the background.</p>

  <p>Another delightful drive leads past the Cave and Basin and
  around the northern end of Sulphur Mountain to Sundance Canyon, a
  weird little <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id=
  "Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span> gorge through which Sundance Creek
  rushes down to its junction with the Bow. The plateau above the
  gorge was at one time a favourite Indian camping ground, and the
  scene of the barbaric Sun Dance.</p>

  <p>On the northern bank of the Bow, high up above the river,
  stand a number of those fantastic natural monuments called
  Hoodoos, an excellent view of which may be gained by taking the
  drive around the Loop to the foot of Mount Rundle.</p>

  <p>So far we have been confined to points of interest at no great
  distance from the village of Banff, and reached in each case by
  well-built carriage roads. Back and forth over these roads
  throughout the season drive streams of pilgrims, absorbing to a
  greater or less extent the manifold beauties of mountain, lake
  and river, wild canyon and sunny meadow, sombre pine woods and
  mountain slopes blazing with the rainbow colours of countless
  wildflowers; but above all, drinking in the glorious sunlight
  and revivifying air of the mountains. The great majority will
  always prefer to worship nature from the comfortable if somewhat
  crowded seat of a tally-ho, with a luxurious hotel to return to
  in the evening, and after all why should one blame them; but
  there <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg
  56]</a></span> will always be some who prefer the wild mountain
  trail to the macadamized road, the cayuse with all his
  idiosyncrasies to the upholstered coach, and the camp-fire to all
  the luxuries of a modern hotel.</p>

  <p>Fortunately there are to-day, and will be for some years to
  come, many miles of trail for each mile of road within the
  confines of the Canadian National Parks. The present policy seems
  to be to gradually develop the trails into carriage roads, but
  one may venture the hope that this policy will not be carried too
  far. The thought of driving to the foot of Mount Assiniboine on a
  motor bus, and having its glories profaned by a professional
  guide perhaps through a megaphone, is too painful to admit.</p>

  <p>The evolution of mountain roads is an interesting problem in
  itself. The foundation is nearly always an Indian trail, one of
  those ancient thoroughfares that run hither and thither
  throughout the mountains, following the courses of innumerable
  streams, and winding up over mountain passes and down again to
  the valleys that lie beyond. There is a peculiar thrill of
  excitement in falling unexpectedly upon one of these relics of
  other days. The imagination leaps back to the time when Indian
  hunters followed them in search <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> of elk and deer,
  mountain goat and bighorn. With the exception of a handful of
  Stonies, whose days are numbered, the Indian no longer hunts in
  the mountains; and the trails he once followed are now mostly
  covered with underbrush or blocked with fallen timber.</p>

  <p>The first step in the conversion of an Indian trail into a
  modern road is to cut through the down timber. Expert axemen are
  sent out for this work, which varies according to circumstances
  from the cutting out of an occasional log to the hewing of a path
  through a tangle of fallen trees ten or fifteen feet high.
  Wherever possible the latter is of course left severely alone,
  but it sometimes happens that no way around the obstacle can be
  found and there is nothing for it but to cut out a path. The huge
  game of jack-straws may cover only a few yards, or it may extend
  for several miles.</p>

  <p>Incidentally the axemen straighten the trail more or less. The
  practice among the Indians, and after them the fur-traders and
  white trappers, was to follow an old trail until a fallen tree
  blocked the way. It would have to be a formidable obstacle to
  stop the average cayuse, but occasionally even that professional
  acrobat was brought to a standstill. The rider in such case
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg
  58]</a></span> never cut his way through if it could be avoided.
  He followed the lines of least resistance, turned right or left
  through the standing timber until he had won around the fallen
  tree and back to the trail again. The next man took the new path,
  until he was perhaps brought up by a later windfall and in his
  turn added another twist to the devious course of the original
  trail. It can readily be imagined that these forest thoroughfares
  did not at any period of their history represent the shortest
  route between any two points; and it may as well be admitted here
  that the policy of every man for himself in trail-making is as
  active to-day as it was a hundred years ago. Each one of us who
  has camped in unfamiliar valleys of the mountains must plead
  guilty to the same selfish practice. Hurrying along the trail,
  anxious perhaps to reach a certain camping-ground before dark,
  the temptation to flank a fallen tree rather than laboriously cut
  through it, is irresistible. The thought is there, though we may
  not admit it, that we may never come this way again, and the next
  man must look out for himself.</p>

  <p>It remains for the trail-makers to unravel the tangled skein
  and reduce it to something very remotely resembling a straight
  line. Having cut <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id=
  "Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span> through the fallen timber and
  roughly bridged the deeper creeks, the result is a good pack
  trail. This is widened and cleared from year to year; levelled,
  graded and provided with substantial bridges, to convert it into
  a carriage road; and finally macadamized. And as the picturesque
  trail is converted into the eminently modern and respectable
  macadamized road, the equally picturesque pack-train disappears
  and in its place we see, and smell, that emblem of the twentieth
  century, the automobile.</p>

  <p>However, let us not meet trouble half-way. There are still,
  thank fortune, many miles of trail in the Canadian national parks
  which the most enterprising automobile could not possibly
  negotiate, and many more miles of wonderful mountain country that
  as yet are even trailess. From the main road which follows the
  Bow River, and roughly speaking runs southeast and northwest
  through the centre of the Banff Park, good trails branch off on
  either side up every important valley. Portions of some of these
  have been converted into roads, such as those to Lake Minnewanka,
  Sundance Canyon and up Spray River. From the Chalet at the
  western end of Lake Minnewanka, where the road now ends, a trail
  has been opened along the north shore of the lake <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> to
  its eastern extremity, through the Devil's Gap and Ghost Valley,
  and across the South Fork of Ghost River to the Stony Indian
  Reserve, which lies just outside the Park.</p>

  <p>Ghost Valley is a weird, uncanny canyon, the scene of many
  wild Indian legends. It is believed to mark the ancient valley of
  the Bow, Minnewanka and a couple of smaller lakes being the sole
  remaining relics of the channel. No water now runs through Ghost
  Valley, though mountain torrents and waterfalls dash down its
  precipitous sides. Each disappears in its limestone bed, which
  must cover a network of subterranean channels. The mountains end
  abruptly in the Devil's Gap, from which one looks out on the
  plains, or rather on the border land between plain and mountain.
  A few miles to the north rises a grim peak known as the Devil's
  Head, and the whole country is studded with Hoodoos and other
  strange natural features appropriate to such a region.</p>

  <p>Sir George Simpson, who entered the mountains by the Devil's
  Gap on his expedition of 1841, camped by the side of Lake
  Minnewanka, which he named Lake Peechee after his guide, a chief
  of the Mountain Crees. Peechee is still remembered in the
  splendid peak which rises behind <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> Mount Inglismaldie.
  Ghost Valley was the scene of an exploit of which Sir George
  Simpson tells the story.</p>

  <p>A Cree and his squaw had been tracked into the valley by five
  warriors of a hostile tribe. "On perceiving the odds that were
  against him, the man gave himself up for lost, observing to the
  woman that as they could die but once they had better make up
  their minds to submit to their present fate without resistance.
  The wife, however, replied that as they had but one life to lose,
  they were the more decidedly bound to defend it to the last, even
  under the most desperate circumstances; adding that, as they were
  young and by no means pitiful, they had an additional motive for
  preventing their hearts from becoming small. Then, suiting the
  action to the word, the heroine brought the foremost warrior to
  the earth with a bullet, while the husband, animated by a mixture
  of shame and hope, disposed of two more of the enemy with his
  arrows. The fourth, who had by this time come to pretty close
  quarters, was ready to take vengeance on the courageous woman
  with uplifted tomahawk, when he stumbled and fell; and in the
  twinkling of an eye the dagger of his intended victim was buried
  in his heart. Dismayed at the death of his four companions, the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg
  62]</a></span> sole survivor of the assailing party saved himself
  by flight, after wounding his male opponent by a ball in the
  arm."</p>

  <p>Other trails lead up Cascade River from the Minnewanka road,
  and over the Park boundaries to the Panther River country,
  connecting also at Sawback Creek with the Forty Mile trail; and
  up the east bank of Spray River, and between the Goat Range and
  the Three Sisters, to Trout Lakes, connecting with the road which
  follows the west bank of the Spray, and continuing on to the foot
  of Mount Assiniboine, just over the Park boundaries, which on
  this southwestern side follow the height of land. Another runs
  from the end of the Sundance Canyon road up Healy Creek to
  Simpson Pass, with a branch trail to Fatigue Mountain on the
  divide; while others again take you up Redearth Creek to Shadow
  Lake and one of the giants of this part of the Rockies, Mount
  Ball, and by way of Johnston Creek to the Sawback Range and its
  wonderful glaciers. It is impossible to give any real impression
  of the marvellous region through which these mountain trails lead
  you, of its scores of great peaks whose turrets, spires or domes
  climb into the very heavens, of its snow-fields and glaciers,
  bleak mountain passes and exquisite alpine meadows <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
  carpeted with millions of flowers, its prim&aelig;val forests and
  rushing torrents, sparkling waterfalls and emerald or turquoise
  lakes. To appreciate the mountains, you must come and see them at
  first hand, and to see them at their very best, you must take
  tent and pony and provisions, not forgetting tobacco if you are a
  normal man, and get well out on the trail, away from hotels and
  railways and every suggestion of the artificial life you have
  left behind you.</p>

  <p><span class="dcap">M</span>OUNT ASSINIBOINE lies about sixteen
  miles from Banff as the crow flies, but by trail it is more than
  twice that distance. It is not visible from any of the lower
  mountains about Banff, such as Tunnel and Sulphur, being hidden
  by the intervening ranges, but if you are sufficient of a
  mountain-climber to win to the summit of Mount Rundle you will
  gain a view of the mighty pyramid to the south that will alone
  make the climb worth while. Cascade Mountain, some miles north of
  the Bow, also offers the ambitious climber an inspiring sight of
  the Matterhorn of the Rockies. Sir James Outram, the famous
  mountaineer, who was the first man to reach the summit of
  Assiniboine, says that the view he had of the peak from the
  summit of Cascade Mountain, towering over two thousand feet above
  where he stood, first fired his ambition to conquer what was then
  believed to be an unscalable peak.</p>

  <p>The first mention of Mount Assiniboine is in the report of the
  Rocky Mountain expedition of <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span> the late George M.
  Dawson, of the Canadian Geological Survey, in 1884. It is quite
  possible that the peak may have been seen by the missionary De
  Smet, who crossed the White Man's Pass in 1845, but he says
  nothing about it in his narrative. Dr. Dawson first saw the peak
  from Copper Mountain, some distance west of Banff, and later from
  White Man's Pass, near what is now the southern extremity of the
  Park. He named it after the tribe of Indians known as the
  Assiniboines.</p>

  <p>But although Dr. Dawson and his party of surveyors saw and
  admired Mount Assiniboine from a distance, neither he nor any
  other white man is known to have reached its base until 1893,
  when R. L. Barrett, an American mountain-climber, with Tom Wilson
  of Banff, made their way to its foot by way of Healy Creek,
  Simpson Pass and Simpson River. Two years later Mr. Barrett made
  a second trip to the mountain by the same route, accompanied this
  time by James F. Porter and Walter Dwight Wilcox, who has since
  become widely known as an interpreter of Rocky Mountain scenery.
  Tom Wilson outfitted the party, but was unable to accompany them.
  He sent, however, one of his best men, Bill Peyto.</p>

  <p>Wilson, Peyto and Fred Stephens are <i>the</i> guides of the
  Canadian Rockies. There are to-day scores of more or less capable
  guides in the various National Parks, but these three alone are
  famous. One or other of them has accompanied, or led, nearly
  every expedition of any note into the unexplored parts of the
  mountains. Tom Wilson is not only a competent outfitter and a
  splendid guide, but he is also a renowned spinner of yarns, and a
  very mine of information on the Rockies. As some one has said of
  him, he knows more about the Canadian Rockies than any other man
  has ever yet possessed. A visit to Tom Wilson is not the least
  delightful of memories that the intelligent tourist will carry
  away with him from Banff. Stephens and Peyto are men of the same
  calibre, unerring on the trail, delightful around the camp-fire,
  and withal thoroughly good fellows. But we must leave them for
  the present, and return to the Assiniboine expedition.</p>

  <p>The first camp was made on Healy Creek, where they arrived
  after a long tramp over a bad trail, soaked through from wet
  brush, but nevertheless thoroughly happy. The camp-fire soon
  dried their clothes, a hot supper was before them, and after that
  they would roll themselves up in their blankets and sleep as only
  those may sleep <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id=
  "Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span> whose bed is of balsam boughs and
  who breathe the life-giving air of the mountains. Above all, they
  were on the road to Assiniboine.</p>

  <p>The next day's journey took them up the north fork of Healy
  Creek, and they camped a few miles from Simpson Pass, crossing
  the continental divide from Alberta into British Columbia the
  following morning. At the summit the snow drifts were fifteen or
  twenty feet deep, though it was the month of July, but as they
  turned down the southerly slope the snow disappeared and in its
  place appeared immense banks of white anemones and yellow Alpine
  lilies. The mossy woods through which the trail led them the
  previous day had been carpeted with the round-leafed orchid, with
  here and there a nodding Calypso, one of the most daintily
  beautiful and fragrant of the mountain flowers.</p>

  <p>On the northern side of the pass they had left behind a stream
  whose waters eventually flow into Hudson Bay. An Indian trail now
  led them through deep and sombre woods, beside the banks of a
  river which empties into the Pacific Ocean. The following day
  they travelled through the Simpson valley, crossing and
  recrossing the river or its small branches, and camping in a high
  valley two thousand feet above the river, above <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> which
  again towered on either side smooth cliffs whose dark faces were
  relieved with silvery waterfalls. Opposite the camp the walls of
  the mountain had been carved by nature into one of those
  curiously realistic representations of a medi&aelig;val castle
  that is found here and there in the Rockies. "One might easily
  imagine that these sharp pinnacles and rocky clefts were
  ramparts, embrasures, and turreted fortifications. But the wild
  goats, marmots and picas were the sole owners of this
  castle."</p>

  <p>A few hours' tramp brought them the next day to the summit of
  a high pass, from which they had their first glimpse of
  Assiniboine, piercing the sky beyond an intervening barrier of
  snowy peaks. Another day's journey, through fallen timber, along
  the winding shore of a beautiful lake, and over a rocky ridge to
  a second lake, brought them to the object of their heart's
  desire. Assiniboine at last!</p>

  <p>"The majestic mountain," says Wilcox, "which is a noble
  pyramid of rock towering above snow fields, was clearly reflected
  in the water surface. Such a picture so suddenly revealed aroused
  the utmost enthusiasm of all our party, and unconsciously every
  one paused in admiration while our horses strayed from the trail
  to graze. Continuing <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id=
  "Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> once more, we traversed some open
  places among low ridges covered with beautiful larches. We passed
  through a delightful region which descended gently for half a
  mile to a treeless moor, where we pitched camp. Behind us was a
  clump of trees, before us Mount Assiniboine, and on our left a
  lake of considerable size, which washed the very base of the
  mountain and extended northwards in the bottom of a broad
  valley."</p>

  <p>Here they remained for a couple of weeks, exploring the
  neighbourhood, and obtaining photographs of the mountain, some of
  which are reproduced in Wilcox's wonderfully illustrated book on
  the Rockies. A couple of days were spent by Wilcox, Barrett and
  Peyto in a complete circuit of the mountain, a distance as they
  were compelled to travel of fifty-one miles, through a country
  for the most part absolutely devoid of trails, and covered in
  places with a very wilderness of fallen timber. For hours their
  only means of travel was along the tops of prostrate trunks piled
  ten and twelve feet above the ground. They were rewarded,
  however, by a magnificent view of the south side of Mount
  Assiniboine, never before revealed to white men.</p>

  <p>The fascination of this singularly noble peak and its splendid
  setting of n&eacute;v&eacute; and glacier, lake <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span> and
  forest, drew Mr. Wilcox to its feet again in 1899, accompanied
  this time by Henry G. Bryant and Louis J. Steele, who made the
  first attempt to climb the mountain, reaching an elevation of ten
  thousand feet. Approaching storms then drove them back, and on
  the last ice slope they both had a narrow escape. Steele lost his
  foothold and dragged Bryant with him. "There was but one possible
  escape from a terrible fall. A projecting rock of considerable
  size appeared not far below, and Steele with a skilful lunge of
  his ice-axe swung round to it and anchored himself in a narrow
  crevice where the snow had melted away. No sooner had he come to
  a stop than Bryant shot over him from above and likewise found
  safety. Otherwise they would have fallen about six hundred feet,
  with serious if not fatal results."</p>

  <p>An incident of the outward journey is so characteristic of one
  of the innumerable phases of Rocky Mountain scenery that one may
  venture to borrow Mr. Wilcox's graphic description: "Whatever
  interest there may have been to learn our whereabouts was
  absorbed upon reaching the ridge crest by a revelation of wild
  and gloomy grandeur that I have never seen equalled. Our little
  band of men and horses were standing upon a craggy ledge, where
  splintered rocks, frost-rent <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span> and rough, rose through
  perpetual snows, making a tower of observation, whence we looked
  out upon a mountain wilderness. Shifting winds were sweeping
  fog-banks and clouds far above the highest trees of a forest-clad
  valley, not faintly discernible through the storm. Yet they were
  below the crest of our lofty pinnacle, where our storm-beaten
  band of horses, steaming in moisture, stood darkly outlined
  against the pale mists. No gleam of light broke through the lurid
  sky. The monotonous grey of falling snow had given place to
  heaving bands of clouds, for the storm was breaking. Then slowly
  and mysteriously beyond a dark abyss rose a beautiful vision of
  mountains clad in new snow. Their bases rested on unsubstantial
  fog, their tops were partially concealed by clinging mists, and
  they were apparently so far away as to seem like the highest
  mountains in the world."</p>

  <p>Their route to the mountain from Banff had been by a branch of
  Healy Creek to the continental divide and along this high plateau
  to Simpson valley; they returned by way of the Spray. This is now
  the recognised route to Assiniboine, along which the Park
  authorities have opened a good trail. Mr. Wilcox describes it as
  the easiest, and at the same time most uninteresting,
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg
  75]</a></span> of several possible routes; and that by way of
  Healy Creek and the continental divide as the most varied and
  attractive. A good trail is now available up Healy Creek to the
  plateau, and no doubt in time it will be extended to Mount
  Assiniboine. Another shorter route by the south fork of Healy
  Creek has also been partially opened; so that in the course of a
  year or two it will be possible to visit the monarch of the
  southern Canadian Rockies by any one of several alternative
  routes.</p>

  <p>Although popularly reputed to be unscalable, attempts were
  made after that of Bryant and Steele to get to the summit of
  Mount Assiniboine, first by two brothers named Walling, and later
  by Bryant and Wilcox, but without success although the first
  record of ten thousand feet was considerably increased. Finally,
  however, in 1901, Mr. (now Sir James) Outram, with two Swiss
  guides, H&auml;sler and Bohren, reached the highest peak after
  six hours' climbing. The story of the climb is modestly told in
  Outram's book, the following passages from which will give some
  idea at least of the stupendous precipices that had to be
  negotiated and the skill and daring demanded in such a climb. On
  the way up Outram rested for a time near the summit of one of the
  spurs of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id=
  "Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> main peak. "Here," he says, "for
  some moments I stood in solemn awe, perched like a statue in a
  lofty niche cut in the topmost angle of a vast, titanic temple,
  with space in front, on either side, above, below, the yawning
  depths lost in the wreathing mists that wrapped the mountain's
  base."</p>

  <p>After a perilous ascent where nerve, sure-footedness, and
  quick judgment were needed every moment, they finally reached the
  summit of the mountain. "One at a time&mdash;the other two
  securely anchored&mdash;we crawled with the utmost caution to the
  actual highest point (an immense snow cornice) and peeped over
  the edge of the huge, overhanging crest, down the sheer wall to a
  great shining glacier 6000 feet or more below.... Perched high
  upon our isolated pinnacle, fully 1500 feet above the loftiest
  peak for many miles around, below us lay unfolded range after
  range of brown-grey mountains, patched with snow and some times
  glacier hung, intersected by deep chasms or broader wooded
  valleys. A dozen lakes were counted, nestling between the
  outlying ridges of our peak, which supply the head-waters of
  three rivers&mdash;the Cross, the Simpson and the Spray."</p>

  <p>After resting on the summit, it was decided to <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
  descend by another and even more difficult route&mdash;one in
  fact that had hitherto been thought impossible. Outram had
  studied it from below, however, and was confident that it could
  be negotiated.</p>

  <p>"Well roped," he writes, "and moving generally one at a time,
  we clambered downward foot by foot, now balancing upon the narrow
  ledge, 5000 feet of space at our right hand; then scrambling down
  a broken wall-end, the rocks so friable that handhold after
  handhold had to be abandoned, and often half a dozen tested
  before a safe one could be found; now, when the ridge became too
  jagged or too sheer, making our cautious way along a tiny ledge
  or down the face itself, clinging to the cold buttresses, our
  fingers tightly clutching the scant projection of some icy knob,
  or digging into small interstices between the rocks; anon, an
  ice-slope had to be negotiated with laborious cutting of steps in
  the hard wall-like surface; and again, cliff after cliff must be
  reconnoitred, its slippery upper rim traversed until a cleft was
  found and a gymnastic descent effected to the ice-bound declivity
  that fell away beneath its base.</p>

  <p>"For close upon 2000 feet the utmost skill and care were
  imperative at every step; for scarcely <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span> half
  a dozen could be taken in that distance where an unroped man who
  slipped would not inevitably have followed the rejected handholds
  and d&eacute;bris, that hurtled down in leaps and bounds to crash
  in fragments on the rocks and boulders far below."</p>

  <p>Beside this daring climb down the steep north ar&ecirc;te of
  Assiniboine may be placed an even more perilous incident of the
  descent of Mount Bryce the following year. Outram had made the
  ascent with the Swiss guide Christian Kaufmann, taking eleven
  hours to reach the summit. With a long and difficult climb down
  the mountain in prospect, and a particularly dangerous cliff to
  be negotiated, which had been troublesome enough on the way up
  and would be much more dangerous now, they spent very little time
  on the summit.</p>

  <p>"It was almost dark," says Outram, "when we approached the
  well remembered cliff, which had been continually on our minds,
  and to reach which before nightfall had been the object of our
  hasty, foodless march. But we arrived too late. And now the
  question arose as to the wisest course to take. We were on the
  horns of a dilemma. To go on meant descending practically in the
  dark a cliff which we had deemed so difficult by daylight as
  almost to be deterred from undertaking it at <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span> all.
  But on the other hand, a night out 10,000 feet above the sea,
  without the smallest vestige of shelter, on the exposed sky-line
  of a ridge swept by an arctic wind, with boots and stockings
  saturated and certain to freeze (and possibly the feet inside as
  well) before the dawn could aid us on our way, and almost
  destitute of food, offered a prospect particularly uninviting. I
  left the decision to Kaufmann. The risk was practically his
  alone. For me, descending first with the good rope in his trusty
  grasp, there was no danger, even should I slip or fail to find a
  hold, except for the short distance where both would be upon the
  face at the same time. For him, a slip, a lost grip or a broken
  hold might mean destruction. But he voted for advance, and at any
  rate I could make a trial and report upon my personal sensations
  before his turn arrived. So I turned my face towards the rock,
  slipped over the edge, and entered on the fateful climb.</p>

  <p>"It will be long before I lose the recollection of those
  seventy feet of cliff. Drawn out for one long hour of
  concentrated tension were the successive experiences of hopeless
  groping in the dark depths for something to rest a foot upon, of
  blind search all over the chilled rocky surface for a knob or
  tiny crack where the numbed fingers <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> might
  find another hold, of agonizing doubt as to their stability when
  found, of eerie thrill and sickening sensation when the
  long-sought support crumbled beneath the stress and hurtled
  downward into the blackness of space, whilst the hollow
  reverberations of its fall re-echoed through the silence. Then
  the strain of waiting on the best, but very questionable,
  protuberances for several tense minutes of motionless suspense,
  whilst the exigencies of the rope compelled Christian to climb
  down fifteen or twenty feet, and I could move again. At long last
  came the marvellous relief of feeling solid and sufficient
  standing-room once more, followed by the still more trying period
  of inactivity, the patient intensity of watching and hauling in
  the slack as the rope came slowly and spasmodically down, telling
  of Christian's gradual descent, the strained anxiety lest any
  accident should happen to my comrade, and, finally, the
  thankfulness of seeing his figure looming close above and in a
  few moments standing by my side, and we could breathe again."</p>

  <p><span class="dcap">T</span>HIRTY-FIVE miles west of Banff on
  the Canadian Pacific Railway, and still in the Rocky Mountains
  Park, is the village of Laggan. You may make the journey by train
  or motor, in either case enjoying a succession of magnificent
  views of mountain peaks on either side, culminating in the
  majestic Mount Temple. From Laggan a tramway or a somewhat dusty
  ride or drive of two or three miles up the mountain side brings
  you to the Chalet, on the shores of Lake Louise; but if you are
  wise you will take the woodland trail and walk. The trail winds
  up through the woods, cool and fragrant, with wildflowers about
  you on every side, charming glimpses of forest glades and
  mountain torrents, and far above the &aelig;olian music of the
  breeze in the tree tops. The trail ends at the Chalet, a
  rambling, picturesque, and thoroughly comfortable hotel, crowded
  with tourists from the ends of the earth. Your thoughts are not,
  however, of hotel or tourists as you look beyond<span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> the
  trees, and get your first vivid impression of what is probably
  the most perfect bit of scenery in the known world. A lake of the
  deepest and most exquisite colouring, ever changing, defying
  analysis, mirroring in its wonderful depths the sombre forests
  and cliffs that rise from its shores on either side, the gleaming
  white glacier and tremendous, snow-crowned peaks that fill the
  background of the picture, and the blue sky and fleecy cloud
  overhead. Year after year you may revisit Lake Louise, and wander
  about its shores through all kinds of weather; you will never
  exhaust the variety of its charms. It changes from day to day,
  from hour to hour, from moment to moment. It responds instantly
  to every subtle change of cloud, wind or atmosphere; it has one
  glory of the sunrise and another of sunset; it offers you one
  picture under the brilliant noonday sun, another under heavy
  clouds, another through driving mists, or rain, or snow; but
  always incomparably beautiful, and always indescribable.</p>

  <p>Let us see how it has appealed to different men, who have
  visited it at different times and under varied conditions. As
  long ago as 1888 William Spotswood Green, of the British Alpine
  Club, climbed up to the shores of Lake Louise on his way back
  from a season's mountain-climbing <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> in the Selkirks. "I
  was," he says, "quite unprepared for the full beauty of the
  scene. Nothing of the kind could possibly surpass it. I was
  somewhat reminded of the Oeschinen See in Switzerland, but Lake
  Louise is about twice as long, the forests surrounding it are far
  richer, and the grouping of the mountains is simply
  perfection."</p>

  <p>"Lake Louise," says Walter Dwight Wilcox, "is a realisation of
  the perfect beauty of nature beyond the power of
  imagination."</p>

  <p>Sir James Outram quotes the final verdict of one whom he
  describes as "a close observer of nature and enthusiastic lover
  of the picturesque," to this effect: "I have travelled in almost
  every country under heaven, yet I have never seen so perfect a
  picture in the vast gallery of Nature's masterpieces." And Outram
  himself writes:</p>

  <p>"As a gem of composition and of colouring it is perhaps
  unrivalled anywhere. To those who have not seen it words must
  fail to conjure up the glories of that 'Haunted Lake among the
  pine-clad mountains, forever smiling upward to the skies.' A
  master's hand indeed has painted all its beauties; the turquoise
  surface, quivering with fleeting ripples, beyond the
  flower-strewn sweep of grassy shore; the darkening mass of
  tapering <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg
  86]</a></span> spruce and pine trees, mantling heavily the
  swiftly rising slopes that culminate in rugged steeps and
  beetling precipices, soaring aloft into the sun-kissed air on
  either side; and there, beyond the painted portals of the
  narrowing valley, rich with the hues of royal purple and of
  sunset reds, the enraptured gaze is lifted to a climax of superb
  effects, and the black walls of Mount Lefroy, surrounded by their
  dazzling canopy of hanging glaciers, and the wide gable-sweep of
  Mount Victoria, resplendent with its spotless covering of eternal
  snow, crown the matchless scene. The azure dome of heaven,
  flecked with bright, fleecy clouds like angel's wings, completes
  the picture."</p>

  <p>Tom Wilson seems to have been the first white man to visit the
  shores of Lake Louise. At least his is the first visit of which
  there is any record. According to Wilcox, he camped with a pack
  train near the mouth of the Pipestone in 1882, when some Stony
  Indians came along and placed their tepees near him. "Not long
  after, a heavy snow-slide or avalanche was heard among the
  mountains to the south, and in reply to inquiry one of the
  Indians named Edwin, the Gold Seeker, said that the thunder came
  from a 'big snow mountain above the lake of little fishes'.
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg
  87]</a></span> The next day Wilson and Edwin rode through the
  forests to the lake of little fishes, which was named
  subsequently for the Princess Louise," then in Canada as the wife
  of the Governor General, the late Duke of Argyll.</p>

  <p>Professor A. P. Coleman, of Toronto University, who has spent
  many summers in the Canadian Rockies, and to whom we are indebted
  for one of the most comprehensive and entertaining narratives of
  exploration in this fascinating field, visited Lake Louise two
  years after Tom Wilson. "I scrambled along its shores," he says,
  "then unnamed and without marks of human habitation where the
  comfortable chalet now rises." Many of us would give a good deal
  to treasure in our memory a picture of Lake Louise sans chalet
  and sans tourists.</p>

  <p>About a quarter of a century ago the Canadian Pacific Railway
  built an unpretentious log inn on the shores of the lake, with
  accommodation for a few guests. This was destroyed by fire in
  1893. It was rebuilt the following year, and has been repeatedly
  enlarged to meet the demands of an ever-growing stream of
  tourists, the last addition costing somewhere in the
  neighbourhood of half a million dollars. The railway has also
  provided a good road and trail from Laggan up to <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span> the
  Chalet, and opened several trails to points of interest about the
  lake. These have since been improved and extended in every
  direction by the Canadian government.</p>

  <p>It is doubtful if any other spot in the mountains accommodates
  itself so generously to all tastes and capacities as does Lake
  Louise. If you are hopelessly indolent, you may stroll down to
  the shore, over a carpet of wildflowers, and lazily enjoy the
  matchless picture of Lefroy and Victoria with the gem of a lake
  in the foreground. Or a half-mile's walk along the excellent
  trail that skirts the right-hand side of the lake will prove a
  revelation of ever-changing and always superb views. The walk may
  be extended to the farther end of the lake, and back by the other
  side where the path climbs along the steep slope of Fairview
  Mountain. An alternative trip, and a particularly delightful one
  in the early morning or the evening twilight, is to take one of
  the boats at the Chalet and row to the end of the lake and back.
  The distance is extraordinarily deceptive. It looks but a
  stone's-throw, yet when you have rowed three-quarters of a mile
  you find that you are not much more than half-way. You look up on
  either side to the towering cliffs, and feel like a water beetle
  in the bottom of a gigantic cup. And <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> what
  a wonderful liquid is contained in this cup; so clear that you
  grow dizzy as you gaze down and down into its unfathomable
  depths, and so marvellously steeped in colour that it is
  impossible to believe as you dip into it that your hand will not
  come up the same deep turquoise.</p>

  <p>From the end of the lake a trail leads to the foot of Victoria
  Glacier, opening up an ever-changing panorama of dazzling
  snow-fields and terrific precipices. This way lies the road of
  the experienced mountaineers who with skill and daring win their
  way to the summits of these giants far up amid the clouds. It was
  by this road and the Lefroy Glacier that Wilcox some years ago
  unexpectedly discovered Paradise Valley.</p>

  <p>A good trail now leads from the Chalet around Saddle Mountain
  to Paradise Valley, but one of the finest views of the valley
  with dainty Lake Annette and the gigantic guardian peaks that
  tower above, Temple, Aberdeen, Sheol and the Mitre, can be
  obtained from Saddle Mountain, reached by an easy trail. One does
  not readily forget the exquisite view that rewards the climber as
  he reaches the summit of the Saddle and stands on the edge of a
  thousand-foot precipice that drops sheer to the valley, and yet
  seems insignificant when the eye goes up and up to the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg
  90]</a></span> glittering peak of Temple Mountain soaring
  thousands of feet above. The very contrast of the frowning walls
  that shut it in on every side lends an additional charm to the
  fairyland that lies at their feet, a perfect picture of green
  meadows, blue lake and silvery streams, most appropriately named
  Paradise Valley.</p>

  <p>From the Saddle a zigzag trail leads to the summit of Fairview
  Mountain, from which one may look down upon Lake Louise whose
  ever-shifting shades of blue and green seem even deeper and
  richer than seen from the shore.</p>

  <p>From the Chalet again a ride or climb up the trail that
  branches off on the right-hand side of the lake brings one to
  Mirror Lake and Lake Agnes. The distance to the former is about
  two miles, and a little more to Lake Agnes. Mirror Lake lies at
  the foot of a curious rock called the Beehive, and Lake Agnes is
  reached by a short climb up the slope of the mountain. The lakes
  themselves are well worth the climb, but one is rewarded as well
  with entirely new views of the encircling peaks, and tramps
  through a bewildering garden of Alpine flowers among which one
  finds the antennaria and bryanthus, which so curiously resemble
  edelweiss and purple heather.</p>

  <p>A short distance north of Lake Agnes is the <span class=

  Little Beehive, a mere knob on the mountain, from which, however,
  a magnificent view is obtained of a far-flung panorama of
  tremendous, snow-clad mountains, blue lakes, green forest slopes
  and sparkling glaciers. "I have never," says Wilcox, "seen this
  glorious ensemble of forests, lakes and snow fields surpassed in
  an experience on the summits of more than forty peaks and the
  middle slopes of as many more in the Canadian Rockies." And, as
  he adds, the viewpoint is accessible to even the most indifferent
  climbers, or may be managed on horseback.</p>

  <p>From the Chalet, also, a trail of ten miles leads to the
  Valley of the Ten Peaks and Moraine Lake, or the valley may be
  reached by a carriage road which extends to the foot of the lake.
  Another trail runs from Moraine Lake around an imposing cliff
  known as the Tower of Babel to Consolation Valley, and still
  another leads in the opposite direction to Wenkchemna
  Glacier.</p>

  <p>A somewhat longer expedition from Lake Louise is by trail west
  to the height of land at Stephen, then down the picturesque
  Valley of the Kicking Horse, and up Cataract Creek on the western
  side of Mount Victoria, to Lake O'Hara. This, however, takes one
  into Yoho Park, of which something will be said in the next
  chapter.</p>

  <p><span class="dcap">T</span>RAVELLING west on the main line of
  the Canadian Pacific Railway, we cross the continental divide at
  or near Stephen. The actual summit is marked by a rustic arch.
  From the steep mountainside comes a little stream which branches
  above; the two branches flow through the arch and then separate,
  one bound for the Pacific the other for the Atlantic.</p>

  <p>This arch marks not only the height of land but also the
  boundary between Rocky Mountains Park and Yoho Park, the former
  in the Province of Alberta, the latter in British Columbia. An
  hour's run brings us to the headquarters of Yoho Park at Field,
  with Mount Stephen's massive dome far above, six thousand four
  hundred feet from where we stand.</p>

  <p>With Field as a starting-point we can reach by road or trail
  all the principal points of interest in the park, the Kicking
  Horse Canyon and the Natural Bridge, Mount Stephen and the famous
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg

  Lake O'Hara, Lake Oesa and Lake McArthur, and the wonderful
  valley from which the park takes its name, with its exquisitely
  beautiful waterfalls.</p>

  <p>At Field, as at Banff in Rocky Mountains Park and Glacier in
  Glacier Park, a number of Swiss guides are stationed throughout
  the season, for the benefit of those who enjoy the pleasures of
  mountain-climbing. Mount Stephen, on account of its accessibility
  and the magnificent views that reward the mountaineer, is the
  most climbed peak in the Canadian Rockies. Unlike some of its
  huge neighbours, such as Cathedral Mountain, Lefroy, Deltaform,
  Hungabee and Goodsir, it is within the capacity of any reasonably
  energetic man or woman, with or without experience in
  mountain-climbing, provided one has the assistance of a competent
  guide.</p>

  <p>In the autumn of 1904 Mount Stephen was climbed under
  conditions that could not be recommended to any but the most
  expert and clearheaded of mountain-climbers. Rev. George Kinney
  was then at Field, and had gone for a solitary ramble to the
  fossil beds on Mount Stephen. After several hours spent in
  gathering trilobites he ate his lunch, and then the desire
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg
  97]</a></span> seized him to get some pictures from the summit of
  the mountain. Shouldering his two cameras he set out to climb the
  peak.</p>

  <p>"It only took a few minutes," he says, "to climb to the top of
  the spur immediately above the fossil bed and to get above the
  last of the struggling timber growth, when there burst into view
  a scene that beggars description: Cathedral Mountain, its
  perpendicular heights searching the very heavens, formed one
  unbroken wall of a vast amphitheatre. There, ridge on ridge, tier
  on tier, the parallel ledges, cushioned with snow, rose in
  countless numbers for thousands of feet. In such places as these
  the spirits of the mountain sit and watch the changing scenes of
  the hills in the vast arena before them. Sometimes it is a
  procession of sheep, or goats, or deer, or bear, or the eagle
  gracefully sailing. Sometimes it is the frisking mountain rat, or
  the whistling marmot, or the busy haymaker curing his crops of
  hay on the hot rocks of the slide. Or again it is the grand
  orchestra of the hills, breaking forth in the roar of the
  avalanche, the scream of the wind, the fall of the cataract, or
  the crumbling of the peaks.</p>

  <p>"For a mile or more it was easy going over a gentle slope
  covered with rocks and snow. The <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span> clouds had gradually
  broken up before the genial warmth of the sun, and the Kicking
  Horse River seemed a little thread of silver that wound, with
  countless twists and turns, in a level valley below. Field, with
  its roundhouses and trains and big hotel seemed but a little dot,
  and when an engine whistled a thousand echoes tossed the sound
  from side to side, from peak to peak, from canyon to canyon,
  until it was lost in immensity.</p>

  <p>"The climb was uneventful up to the time the cliffs near the
  top were reached. It had been a fairly easy slope all the way.
  The snow began at timber line, and was hard enough to walk on its
  top. Mount Dennis was slowly left behind and sank to a mere
  hillock beneath. Mounts Field and Burgess gradually slipped down
  until Wapta and then the Vice-President, with an emerald glacier
  in its lap, came in full view from behind.</p>

  <p>"By making a detour I could have found an easier way, but,
  having no guide and never having been there before, I began to
  climb the wall of rock immediately in front. It was a most
  difficult climb. The short day was nearly ended, the warmth of
  the sun had given place to a raw, cold wind, and my pack being
  large and heavy got in the way. Nearing the top of this almost
  vertical <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg
  99]</a></span> cliff my numb fingers slipped and I barely escaped
  a sheer fall of fully one hundred feet. Surmounting the cliff, it
  proved but a vanguard of many. Height on height of barefaced
  cliffs offered their resistance in succession, each crowned with
  snow-covered ledges. Gradually, however, they were vanquished,
  one by one, and at last I stood on the glory-crowned summit, ten
  thousand five hundred feet above the sea.</p>

  <p>"Mounts Field, Burgess and Wapta lay far beneath. President
  and Vice-President gleamed and glistened in the near distance.
  Cathedral Mountain, close by, seemed almost on a level. Here,
  there, everywhere, some in groups, others in serried ranks, were
  massed the war-scarred veterans of an innumerable host&mdash;the
  rugged remnants of a vast ancient plateau stretching north,
  southeast and west, as far as the eye could see. All this vast
  array of snow-clad peaks, frowning precipices, glistening
  glaciers, and yawning gulfs was burnished with the glowing hues
  of the setting sun. I watched him sink behind the distant fringe
  of peaks in the west, and when he was gone how lonely and chill
  those sombre old masses seemed. I shouted aloud, but my voice was
  immediately swallowed up in that awful stillness, for there was
  nothing to give it an echo.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg
  100]</a></span></p>

  <p>"I did not stay long on the summit, for the raw, cold winds
  that had frozen the snow in crystals several inches long chilled
  one to the bone. The darkness of night began to swallow up the
  distant hills, and it was necessary to get down the cliffs while
  there was still light to see the way. I had gone but a short
  distance when, following a ledge around more to the south, I made
  a grand discovery. There, filling a steep, rugged ravine that
  seemed to extend all the way to Cathedral Mountain was a smooth
  pathway of snow, steep as the roof of a house. One question
  flashed to my mind: would it be frozen too hard? I cautiously
  tried it. Yes! it was hard, but with care it could be travelled.
  By launching out freely and letting the whole weight come down on
  each foot at a time, the heels could be forced a couple of inches
  into the solid snow. Here, indeed, was the best kind of speedy
  going: swing out one foot, spring from the other, and land on the
  heel in an inch or two of snow. Each stride covered a distance of
  several feet, and it was possible to run down that steep
  precipice of snow as fast as I liked, but my life depended on
  each heel getting that little two inches of a hold; one slip
  would mean a fearful slide to death. There was no danger of
  crevices, for it was all new snow.</p>

  <p>"In an amazingly short time a descent of hundreds of feet had
  been made, until finally the bottom of the cliffs was reached.
  Then I started across and down that long, tedious slope of snow
  and boulders." Finally he regained the fossil beds, picked up his
  belongings, and made his way back to Field in the dark.</p>

  <p>To climb Mount Stephen alone, and in October, is a feat that
  would be considered foolhardy by any mountaineer less capable and
  sure-headed than George Kinney. Mr. Kinney has since proved his
  mettle on a much more formidable climb, to the summit of the
  monarch of the Canadian Rockies, Mount Robson. This, however,
  will stand for a later chapter.</p>

  <p>The road from Stephen, or Hector, down to Field is an
  exceedingly interesting one, and worth taking in as leisurely a
  manner as possible, on an easy-going pony, or better still on
  foot. Leaving Hector, the road skirts the shores of Wapta Lake,
  whose waters are of the deepest blue; Cataract Creek trail here
  leads off to the south, to Lake O'Hara about eight miles distant
  beyond the great white peak of Mount Victoria; the Cathedral
  Crags lie directly ahead to the west, and beneath winds the
  wildly impressive Canyon of the Kicking Horse. As the road
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg
  102]</a></span> drops rapidly down the valley, one is lost in
  amazement at the temerity of the engineers who dared to carry a
  railway through this seemingly impossible gorge, with its
  gradient of nearly 200 feet in the mile. As we leave the Canyon
  behind, Mount Stephen fills the view ahead, with Field and Wapta
  to the right, and the beautiful Yoho Valley opening up to the
  north, where the Wapta icefield and Mount Habel are visible in
  the distance.</p>

  <p>One of the most delightful expeditions in Yoho Park is that to
  Lake O'Hara and Lake McArthur. These may be reached either from
  Laggan in Rocky Mountains Park, or from Field in the Yoho. Outram
  recommends that if at all possible the approach should be made
  from Laggan and Lake Louise, by way of Abbot Pass, using the
  easier but less picturesque Cataract trail for the return
  journey. This makes a somewhat strenuous trip for those who may
  not be accustomed to climbing, but otherwise is thoroughly worth
  the extra effort. The way leads around Lake Louise, and over the
  Victoria Glacier to Abbot Pass, with the tremendous precipices of
  Lefroy and Victoria frowning down on either side. From the
  glacier the way to the pass is up a steep, narrow gorge known as
  the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg
  103]</a></span> Death Trap on account of the numerous avalanches
  that hurtle down from the mountain tops. The danger, however, is
  more apparent than real, and nothing has ever happened to justify
  the sinister name.</p>

  <p>From the summit of the pass the view is one of indescribable
  grandeur, a wilderness of gigantic cliffs far and near,
  stretching up and up to glittering summits. Scrambling down the
  steep descent, Lake Oesa comes into view far below, at the foot
  of Mount Yukness. Oesa is an Indian word meaning Ice, and the
  lake has been appropriately named as, on account of its
  elevation, it is frozen over throughout the greater part of the
  year and never quite free from ice. A climb down ledges and talus
  slopes brings one to the little lake, and from here the first
  glimpse is caught of the exquisitely beautiful Lake O'Hara in the
  valley far below. As one gets nearer, the loveliness of this
  secluded lake grows, and is all the more compelling because of
  the absolute stillness, no chalet or carriages or boats or human
  interlopers other than ourselves. The colouring is as perfect, as
  varied and as utterly beyond description as that of Lake Louise.
  The lake is an Alpine gem, in whose bright surface are reflected
  the green of the forest that surrounds its shores, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
  and the mountains that enclose it on either side, the huge bulk
  of Mount Schaffer and the curious pinnacles of the Wiwaxy Peaks.
  A couple of miles to the southwest, and reached by a good trail,
  is Lake McArthur, another mountain tarn only a little less
  charming than Lake O'Hara.</p>

  <p>If one has only a limited time to spend in the Park, however,
  unquestionably it should be devoted to the Yoho Valley, on the
  north side of the railway. Several good roads and trails now lead
  to the valley from Field, by way of Emerald Lake, Burgess Pass
  and the Yoho River, so that the visitor has a choice of routes,
  and is assured of many enchanting views both going and
  coming.</p>

  <p>The valley was explored as long ago as 1897 by Jean Habel, a
  famous German mountaineer, who spent seventeen days there and
  returned with such enthusiastic accounts of mountains, lakes and
  wonderful waterfalls that it was determined to make the valley
  accessible to tourists. A trail was commenced by the Canadian
  Pacific Railway in 1900, and since the organisation of the
  district into a national park this first attempt has been
  extended into a system of roads and trails giving access to every
  part of the valley. A delightful drive through "aisles of stately
  firs," and over a good wagon road, brings one to Emerald
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg
  105]</a></span> Lake, where the Railway Company, with its
  customary thoughtfulness, has provided a comfortable and
  picturesque chalet, situated on a wooded promontory. The lake,
  says Outram, is a "gem of perfect beauty, its colouring
  marvellously rich and vivid, and constantly changing under the
  shifting lights and shades." In its surface are mirrored the
  ramparts and precipices of Mount Wapta and Mount Burgess and the
  snowy glaciers of President Mountain.</p>

  <p>From Emerald Lake, the road winds up the valley, with ever
  changing views of the mighty peaks on either side. We are
  waiting, however, for our first glimpse of the glory of the
  valley, Takakkaw Falls, remembering the meaning of the Indian
  name, "It is wonderful!" Presently we come out of the forest, the
  falls are before us across the valley, and we can do nothing but
  echo the exclamation of the Indians. To borrow again from Sir
  James Outram, "the torrent issuing from an icy cavern rushes
  tempestuously down a deep, winding chasm till it gains the verge
  of the unbroken cliff, leaps forth in sudden wildness for a
  hundred and fifty feet, and then in a stupendous column of pure
  white sparkling water, broken by giant jets descending
  rocket-like and wreathed in volumed spray, dashes upon
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg
  106]</a></span> the rocks almost a thousand feet below, and
  breaking into a milky series of cascading rushes for five hundred
  feet more, swirls into the swift current of the Yoho River."</p>

  <p>Farther up the valley we come to the less imposing but even
  more picturesque Twin Falls, and the appropriately named Laughing
  Fall, where the Upper Yoho leaps down the mountain side. It is
  impossible to give more than a mere impression of the charms of
  this delightful valley. It would indeed be difficult to find
  anywhere else a more perfect grouping of the elements of Rocky
  Mountain scenery, great peaks and glaciers, stately forests and
  meadows carpeted with wildflowers, rushing streams, lakes of the
  most exquisite colouring, and a group of waterfalls as varied in
  character as they are all strikingly beautiful.</p>

  <p><span class="dcap">A</span>S we leave Field behind, and slide
  rapidly down the western slope of the Rockies to the Columbia
  valley, revelling in the ever-changing panorama of stately peaks,
  and enjoying it all from a comfortable arm-chair in the
  observation car, it is interesting to recall the very different
  journey of Sir Sandford Fleming in 1883. He had been the chief
  engineer of the Canadian Pacific Railway surveys from 1871 to
  1880, and had strongly advocated the Yellowhead Pass route
  through the mountains in preference to the Kicking Horse Pass.
  His judgment has since been vindicated by the selection of the
  former route by both the new Canadian transcontinental roads, the
  Grand Trunk Pacific and the Canadian Northern.</p>

  <p>When the Canadian Pacific Railway was taken over from the
  Dominion Government by a syndicate, it was decided to build
  through the Kicking Horse. In 1883 the rails had been laid as far
  as <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg
  110]</a></span> Calgary, at the eastern entrance to the
  mountains, actually before there was any certainty that it would
  be possible to get through by the southern route. The Kicking
  Horse Pass was believed to be feasible though presenting many
  serious engineering difficulties, but that only took them through
  the main range. There were still the Selkirks and the Gold Range
  to cross, before they could reach Kamloops on the North Thompson
  River, beyond which the route had been selected and the rails
  partly laid; but all the information the Company then had was a
  vague report that a route might be found over the former by
  Rogers Pass and over the latter by Eagle Pass. Very little was
  known of either.</p>

  <p>The directors of the Company were between the horns of a
  dilemma. If they went ahead, they might find themselves stranded
  on the east side of the Selkirks. On the other hand, to abandon
  the route would mean the loss of millions of dollars already
  expended in bringing the rails to Calgary. In their difficulty
  they sent for Fleming, and asked him to go over the ground
  between Calgary and Kamloops and let them know if the railway
  could be taken through the three ranges, the Rockies, Selkirks
  and Gold Range. One can imagine the famous engineer <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
  chuckling over the situation. He had recommended the Yellowhead
  route; his advice had been rejected; and now the advocates of the
  rival Kicking Horse route were compelled to fall back upon him,
  to beg him of all men to demonstrate the practicability of the
  southern route. He accepted the commission, went over the route
  thoroughly, and was able to report that the railway could be
  taken through from Calgary to Kamloops. What he saw, however, was
  very far from shaking his former opinion that the Yellowhead Pass
  route was preferable in every way to that by the Kicking
  Horse.</p>

  <p>This is merely introductory to a paragraph or two from Sir
  Sandford Fleming's account of his journey through the mountains
  in 1883&mdash;something to ponder over as we rush down the same
  wild valley in our luxurious observation car.</p>

  <p>Fleming had left the railway at Calgary, and with ponies and
  pack-horses had slowly forced his way to the summit of the main
  range, and was now climbing down the valley of the Kicking Horse
  to the Columbia. We pick him up one morning, somewhere about the
  western boundary of what is now Yoho Park.</p>

  <p>"The mist hangs like a thick curtain, concealing <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
  everything not directly near the camp-fire. But we start; the six
  pack-horses in front with their loads standing out from their
  backs, giving the creatures the appearance of so many
  dromedaries. Dave rides ahead with the bell-horse, then the
  pack-horses follow, and the horsemen bring up the rear to see
  that none stray behind. Our journey this day is over exceedingly
  rough ground. We have to cross gorges so narrow that a biscuit
  might be thrown from the last horse descending to the bell-horse
  six hundred feet ahead, ascending the opposite side.</p>

  <p>"The fires have been running through the wood and are still
  burning; many of the half-burnt trees have been blown down by
  last night's gale, obstructing the trail and making advance
  extremely difficult.... Fortunately there is no wind. The air is
  still and quiet, otherwise we would run the risk of blackened
  trunks falling around us, possibly upon the animals or ourselves,
  even at the best seriously to have impeded our progress, if such
  a mischance did not make an advance impossible until the wind
  should moderate.</p>

  <p>"We move forward down and up gorges hundreds of feet deep,
  amongst rocky masses where the poor horses have to clamber as
  best they can <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id=
  "Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> amid sharp points and deep
  crevices, running the constant risk of a broken leg. The trail
  now takes another character. A series of precipices run sheer up
  from the boiling current to form a contracted canyon. A path has
  therefore been traced along the hill side, ascending to the
  elevation of some seven or eight hundred feet. For a long
  distance not a vestige of vegetation is to be seen. On the steep
  acclivity our line of advance is narrow, so narrow that there is
  scarcely a foothold; nevertheless we have to follow for some six
  miles this thread of trail, which seemed to us by no means in
  excess of the requirements of the chamois and the mountain
  goat.</p>

  <p>"We cross clay, rock and gravel slides at a giddy height. To
  look down gives one an uncontrollable dizziness, to make the head
  swim and the view unsteady, even with men of tried nerves. I do
  not think that I can ever forget that terrible walk. We are from
  five to eight hundred feet high on a path of from ten to fifteen
  inches wide and at some points almost obliterated, with slopes
  above and below us so steep that a stone would roll into the
  torrent in the abyss below."</p>

  <p>A few miles more, and Fleming emerged from the valley of the
  Kicking Horse and stood on the banks of the Columbia, with the
  mighty walls of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id=
  "Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span> the Rockies and Selkirks towering
  above him to the east and to the west. His way through the
  Selkirks was by the same route that we now follow on the railway,
  and it brought him in time to the summit of Rogers Pass, and the
  first sight of the since famous Illecillewaet Glacier. As we
  follow in his footsteps, we find ourselves entering the third
  great National Park of Canada&mdash;appropriately named Glacier
  Park, for from any one of its great peaks one may count a score
  of these wonderful ice rivers.</p>

  <p>The Selkirk Range strikes even the unobservant traveller as
  markedly different from the main range of the Rockies. The
  colouring of the rocks is more varied and less sombre; the
  valleys are deeper and clothed with dense forests of gigantic
  evergreens, cedar, spruce, hemlock, Douglas fir, and up near the
  extreme limit of vegetation the beautiful Lyall's larch; and the
  snowfall is very much heavier than in the more easterly range.
  From its geographical position the Selkirk Range intercepts a
  large percentage of the moisture borne inland from the Pacific,
  which would otherwise reach the Rockies, and this with the deep
  valleys has resulted in a vegetation that is almost tropical in
  its luxuriance, and infinite in its variety, something over five
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg
  115]</a></span> hundred different flowers alone having been
  discovered in Glacier Park.</p>

  <p>Geologists tell us that the Selkirks are very much older than
  the main range, that in fact they were hoary with antiquity when
  as the result of some vast convulsion of nature the Rockies were
  born. The brilliantly coloured quartzites of the Selkirks belong
  to an age so remote that the mere thought of it is enough to make
  one's head reel. In their day they looked out to the eastward
  upon a great sea, covering what are to-day vast fertile plains,
  and the sea washed over the place where the giants of the Rockies
  now lift their snowy heads proudly into the heavens.</p>

  <p>Compared with Rocky Mountain Park, Glacier Park is a
  comparatively small reservation, covering an area of 468 square
  miles, but any one capable of appreciating the glories of
  mountain scenery, the great valleys with their picturesque
  torrents and waterfalls and riotous vegetation; the upper slopes
  with their bewildering array of alpine flowers, dryas, anemones
  and mountain lilies, red and white heather, glowing masses of
  painter's-brush, yellow and purple asters, blue gentians and
  yellow columbines, delicate moss campion and the dear little
  forget-me-not; the dizzy precipices and dazzling glaciers;
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg
  116]</a></span> and the conquered summits with their glorious
  outlook over a world of indescribable wildness and
  grandeur,&mdash;will find here a region of perpetual delight,
  where he may roam afield for weeks each day on an entirely new
  trail.</p>

  <p>Although the park as a park did not exist until long after his
  visit, and good roads and trails now take the place of the rough
  paths he had to follow, William Spotswood Green's <i>Among the
  Selkirk Glaciers</i>, is still the most satisfactory and
  entertaining introduction that one can find, or wish for, to this
  mountain playground. Green came to the Selkirks in 1888, after
  years of delightful experience in the Alps and the great
  mountains of New Zealand. He left with the conviction that he had
  seen nothing elsewhere more impressive or more fascinating than
  these mountains of British Columbia. "Dark green forest, rushing
  streams, purple peaks, silvery ice, a cloudless sky, and a most
  transparent atmosphere," he says, "all combine to form a perfect
  Alpine paradise."</p>

  <p>One of his first visits was to the Illecillewaet Glacier,
  which then entailed a slow and more or less painful scramble
  through a wilderness of fallen timber, tangled thickets of alder
  scrub, and the appropriately named devil's club. To-day
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg
  117]</a></span> one reaches the foot of the glacier by way of a
  delightful and well-kept trail through the forest, the trail
  starting from the doors of Glacier House, the large and
  comfortable hotel maintained by the Canadian Pacific Railway at
  the headquarters of the park.</p>

  <p>On the way he had an opportunity of observing the tremendous
  destructive power of avalanches. "The hemlock, balsam, and
  Douglas firs, though as stout as ships' masts, had been snapped
  off close to their roots; some were torn up and driven long
  distances from where they grew, and lay in heaps, but the general
  position of the trunks pointed distinctly to the direction from
  which the destroying avalanche had come. Even the boulders of the
  moraine showed signs of having been shifted, some of them huge
  blocks of quartzite, one I measured 50 X 33 X 24 feet. No better
  illustration could be presented of the overwhelming power of an
  avalanche, though composed of nothing else than the accumulation
  of a winter's snow."</p>

  <p>On this or another expedition, Green was introduced to the
  idiosyncrasies of the Indian pony or cayuse. One had been taken
  as a pack horse, and picked his way demurely along the trail for
  some time, with that air of meek innocence which <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
  always imposes upon the tenderfoot. Suddenly, without a moment's
  warning, and for no apparent reason, he was "seized with a
  paroxysm of buck-jumping; the packs flew off, he rolled down
  through the ferns and rocks, and then, perfectly satisfied with
  his performance, stood patiently while we restored our goods on
  his back." The incident will bring back many similar experiences
  to those who have camped in the Rocky Mountains. One is almost
  tempted to chuckle over Green's bewilderment. It is generally
  found that there is reason in the pony's madness. When he runs
  unexpectedly into a hornet's nest, the most natural thing in the
  world is to get away from it as quickly as possible, and as a
  rule the quickest way is to roll down hill.</p>

  <p>Exasperating as the cayuse can be on many occasions, no one
  who has any sense of humour or any appreciation of animal
  intelligence can fail in time to grow very fond of a horse that
  has been his companion on many wild mountain trails, that has
  carried him safely through raging torrents, and sometimes shared
  his meal beside the camp fire. A good pony will follow unerringly
  a trail that is indistinguishable to even an experienced guide;
  he will carry an able-bodied man, or a much heavier pack, all day
  over a trail that would <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119"
  id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> kill an eastern horse; he will
  pick his way through a tangle of fallen timber with an instinct
  that is almost uncanny; and he will do all this on the uncertain
  feed of mountain camps. He is a true philosopher, a creature of
  shrewd common sense, pluck, endurance, and rare humour, a good
  fellow, and a rare friend.</p>

  <p>Green made the first attempt to scale Mount Sir Donald, the
  splendid peak that almost overshadows Glacier House. He selected
  what proved to be an impracticable route, and was forced to
  return without reaching the summit. The mountain has since been
  repeatedly climbed, and is now with Mount Stephen in the Rockies
  the most popular peak for mountain-climbers in the Canadian
  parks. Thanks to the Swiss guides who are stationed here
  throughout the season, any one of reasonable endurance and with a
  head for dizzy heights or depths, can now make his way to the
  summit of Sir Donald, 10,808 feet above the sea, and be rewarded
  with a view that will more than compensate him for the
  fatigue.</p>

  <p>Although mountain-climbing in the Canadian Rockies has been
  singularly free from accidents, there have of course occasionally
  been narrow escapes, and one of these is graphically described in
  <i>Among the Selkirk Glaciers</i>. Green and a <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
  companion had climbed to the summit of Mount Bonney, a great peak
  some miles west of Sir Donald, and were returning, when they made
  the usual mistake of trying a short cut to avoid a tedious piece
  of climbing. There seemed to be a way down a very steep snow
  slope, and Green went ahead on the rope to test it, while his
  companion anchored himself as firmly as possible in the snow
  above. They were of course "roped" in the usual mountaineering
  fashion.</p>

  <p>"I turned my face to the slope," says Green, "and holding on
  to the rope kicked my toes in and went over the brink. I took the
  precaution, too, of burying my axe up to its head at every step.
  Just below the brink there was a projecting crag. This I thought
  would give a firm footing before testing the snow slope. I got
  one foot on to it and was taking it as gently as possible when
  the rock gave way, a large piece of snow went with it and fell on
  the slope twenty feet below.</p>

  <p>"I stuck my knees into the snow, but felt my whole weight was
  on the rope. Then I heard a swishing noise in the air, and
  glancing downwards saw that the whole snow slope had cracked
  across and was starting away down towards the valley in one huge
  avalanche. H. hauled cautiously <span class='pagenum'><a name=

  rope, and getting what grip I could with toes, knees and ice-axe
  I was quickly in a safe position, and the two of us standing side

  the huge masses bounding outwards. We listened to the sullen roar
  which gradually subsided and all again was quiet."</p>

  <p>It was probably this same stout rope by which Green pulled
  himself back to safety, of which he elsewhere gives the history,
  quite an eventful one, though sadly ignoble in its latter days.
  "Its first good work was to save the lives of some of our party
  in a bad slip, near the summit of the Balmhorn on the Bernese
  Overland. It was next used as the mizzen topping-lift of a
  fifteen-ton yawl. It was my tent-rope in the New Zealand Alps. It
  was the bridle used on a deep-sea trawl that went down to 1000
  fathoms beneath the surface of the Atlantic. It trained a colt.
  Now it was in our diamond hitch; and I regret to say that its old
  age was disgraced by its being used for cording one of my boxes
  on the voyage home."</p>

  <p>Compared with Rocky Mountains Park and Yoho Park, Glacier Park
  at present is somewhat deficient in roads and trails, those that
  have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id=
  "Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> opened all radiating from
  headquarters and extending not more than six or eight miles in
  any direction. This, however, will be remedied in a few years,
  the park being still very young, and in the meantime it is not an
  unmixed evil to those who care to get off the beaten track. Old
  Indian trails follow all the rivers and creeks throughout the
  park, and though these will be more or less obliterated and
  blocked with fallen timber, a competent guide can always be
  relied upon to take you to any corner of the park, and when you
  have found a good camping ground, with feed for the horses, a
  sparkling stream at your feet, and a circle of noble peaks
  smiling down upon you, you will, if you are the right sort, thank
  your stars that railways and hotels and roads lie far away in
  another world beyond the mountains. To really enjoy this
  sensation of out-of-the-worldness, however, you must have brought
  with you a sufficient supply of worldly eatables.</p>

  <p>Of the available trails, one leads up to Rogers Pass, at the
  summit of the Selkirks, with Mount Macdonald on one side and
  Mount Tupper on the other. These two great peaks were named after
  the famous Canadian statesmen, Sir John Macdonald and Sir Charles
  Tupper. The latter, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id=
  "Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> after watching the growth of
  Canada from a group of weak and scattered colonies to a strong
  and ambitious Dominion, is still alive in England in his
  ninety-third year.</p>

  <p>In the opposite direction, good trails lead to the
  Illecillewaet Glacier, and to Asulkan Pass and the Asulkan
  Glacier, from which it is possible to reach a group of
  magnificent peaks, Castor and Pollux, The Dome, Clarke, Swanzy,
  and a little farther to the west Bonney and Smart. On the
  opposite side lies the vast Illecillewaet snow-field.</p>

  <p>From Glacier House, again, a good carriage road takes you west
  parallel with the railway and the Illecillewaet River, towards
  Cougar Mountain and Ross Peak. Eventually this will be extended
  to the Nakimu Caves. At present a trail follows the same route to
  the Caves, and around Mount Cheops to Rogers Pass, thus providing
  a round trip, from Glacier House to the Caves, thence to Rogers
  Pass, and back to Glacier House again.</p>

  <p>The Nakimu Caves were discovered accidentally some nine years
  ago, and are said to be well worth visiting. They are in charge
  of C. H. Deutschmann, who discovered and explored them, and
  thanks to his competent guidance and <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
  the facilities that have been provided it is now possible for any
  one to visit and examine this curious freak of nature. It will be
  more convenient to describe the Caves in another chapter.</p>

  <p>Those who would really wish to know the character, extent and
  variety of the scenery in Glacier Park and the great mountain
  range of which it is only a small part, are recommended to
  consult A. O. Wheeler's delightful guide-book, <i>The Selkirk
  Mountains</i>, and the same author's exhaustive work published by
  the Dominion Government, <i>The Selkirk Range</i>. These are not
  only readable and authoritative, but with the exception of
  Green's <i>Among the Selkirk Glaciers</i>, they are the only
  books available on this very important region.<a name=

  <p><span class="dcap">T</span>HE traveller who for the sake of
  contrast or variety desires to enjoy a sensation as different as
  possible from the glorious panorama of mountain and valley, lake
  and waterfall, rich in colouring, instinct with the life-giving
  qualities of sun and air, cannot do better than spend an
  afternoon in the Caves of Nakimu. It will be to him as though he
  were transported from the domains of the Upper Gods to the gloomy
  realm of Pluto. Under the guardianship of C. H. Deutschmann, the
  official guide, whose cabin stands across a small ravine from the
  visitor's camp, the caves may be explored with safety and a
  reasonable degree of comfort. The facilities for getting about
  the caves and underground passages is still rather primitive, but
  sufficient to ensure the safety of visitors, and you have the
  advantage of seeing everything in its natural state. One can
  appreciate the hardihood of Deutschmann, who alone, and with
  nothing but tallow candles, explored caves and potholes
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg
  128]</a></span> and corridors. As Mr. Wheeler has said, "Added to
  the thick darkness, there was always the fierce, vibrating roar
  of subterranean torrents, a sound most nerve-shaking in a
  position sufficiently uncanny without it. Huge cracks had to be
  crossed and precipitous descents made in pitch darkness, where a
  misstep meant death or disablement."</p>

  <p>The caves extend into the south slopes of Mount Ursus Major
  and Mount Cheops and into the north slopes of Cougar Mountain.
  The rock out of which the caves have been carved, by Nature's
  patient craftsmen, is described as a "marbleized limestone,
  varying in colour from very dark blue, almost black, shot with
  ribbons of calcite, through varying shades of grey to almost
  white." There are no stalactites or stalagmites worth
  mentioning.</p>

  <p>The caves are in three sections, known as the Gopher Bridge,
  Mill Bridge, and the Gorge. The following description is taken
  from Arthur O. Wheeler's account of his survey in 1905.</p>

  <p>The Gopher Bridge caves are approached by two openings, one
  known as the Old Entrance, the other as the New Entrance. Mr.
  Wheeler used the former in his visit, and took his observation by
  the light of gas lamps and magnesium wire. Not far from the
  entrance he came to a <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129"
  id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span> place where the passage dropped
  suddenly into space. "Standing on a ledge that overhangs a black
  abyss," he says, "the eye is first drawn by a subterranean
  waterfall heard roaring immediately on the left. It appears to
  pour from a dark opening above it. Below, between black walls of
  rock, may be seen the foam-flecked torrent hurtling down the
  incline until lost in dense shadows. Overhead, fantastic spurs
  and shapes reach out into the blackness, and the entire
  surroundings are so weird and uncanny that it is easy to imagine
  Dante seated upon one of these spurs deriving impressions for his
  Inferno. As the brilliant light gives out, the thick darkness
  makes itself felt, and instinctively you feel to see if Charon is
  not standing beside you. This subterranean stream with its
  unearthly surroundings is suggestive of the Styx and incidentally
  supplied the name Avernus for the cavern of the waterfall." The
  Cavern of Avernus is reached by the New Entrance, through a small
  passage.</p>

  <p>Cougar Brook emerges from the Gopher Bridge caves 450 feet
  down the valley, and after pouring down a rock-cut known as the
  Flume, disappears into the Mill Bridge caves. The entrance is
  some thirty feet to the east, through a cleft in the rock. A
  passageway of 400 feet <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130"
  id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span> leads to an irregularly shaped
  chamber known as the Auditorium, through which Cougar Brook roars
  its way. "Faint daylight enters through the passageway of the
  waters, making the place look dim and mysterious." The passageway
  is broken at intervals by potholes, ten or fifteen feet deep,
  necessitating a series of rough ladders, and in one case a
  floating bridge as the pothole is half filled with water.</p>

  <p>Emerging from the Mill Bridge caves, the brook runs for 300
  feet through a deep gorge spanned by two natural bridges, and
  then enters the third series of caves. Creeping down a long
  passageway, with the dull roar of the stream ever in your ears,
  you come to a sharp descent of twelve feet with natural
  footholds, but persons unaccustomed to climbing are advised to
  use a rope to steady the descent. "Here the brook is heard far
  down rushing through some rock-cut with a dull intermittent
  pounding like the blows of a giant sledge-hammer."</p>

  <p>A passage to the right brings you to the Dropping Cave, with
  walls and ceiling of dark blue limestone streaked with white
  calcite, and water dropping everywhere from the roof. From the
  eastern end of this cave a narrow passage leads to the Witch's
  Ball Room, a triangular <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131"
  id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> cavern whose floor is broken by
  deep cracks "leading down to where the underground stream roars
  threateningly." Beyond this are several other passages and
  smaller chambers, the farthest known as the Pit.</p>

  <p>Another entrance to the Gorge caves, known as Entrance No. 3,
  leads first to a small cavern, reached by a ladder from above. A
  very narrow passage, which must be negotiated by means of a rope,
  brings you to a ledge overlooking a sheer drop of sixty feet.</p>

  <p>From one of the passages leading to the Pit, a cavern is
  reached, named the Turbine, owing to the noise from waterspouts
  resembling the sound of water falling into the pit of a turbine.
  Farther on is the Art Gallery, so called from the "florescent
  designs of overlying carbonate of lime, in colour from cream to
  delicate salmon."</p>

  <p>Beyond the Art Gallery, a long passage brings you to a narrow
  twisted opening named the Gimlet, and to two ancient potholes
  leading to unknown depths, and "profusely ornamented with
  florescent incrustation." One of these is named the Dome, from
  its perfect form. A passage from the other leads to the Judgment
  Hall.</p>

  <p>In this section of the Gorge Caves the subterranean river
  crosses the main passage some depth <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
  below, and its roar is now heard from the right side. A narrow
  opening leads to the Carbonate Grotto which has some fine floral
  designs. Another passage of 130 feet brings you to a crack in the
  wall, from which a descent of 57 feet leads to the Judgment Hall
  mentioned before. This is the largest of the caves, 200 feet wide
  and from 40 to 50 feet high.</p>

  <p>From the Judgment Hall, other passages lead to the White
  Grotto, so named from the beauty and delicacy of its
  ornamentations; and the Bridal Chamber, also covered with floral
  designs.</p>

  <p>The Caves of Nakimu are of peculiar interest to the geologist,
  as the limestone of which they are composed is rare in the
  Selkirks. The subterranean stream which forms the principal
  feature of the caves is also a rare phenomenon either in the
  Rockies or Selkirks. There is some difference of opinion as to
  the origin of the caves. The passageways are unquestionably due
  in a measure to water-erosion, but Mr. Wheeler, who has given the
  matter much study, is convinced that a more potent agency has
  been at work. "It is not unreasonable to assume," he says, "that
  a seismic disturbance once shattered this bed of crystalline
  limestone and precipitated <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> Cougar Creek into
  subterranean channels which the water and time have enlarged to
  their present size; moreover, that subsequent shocks are
  responsible for the large quantities of d&eacute;bris that litter
  their floors. This hypothesis would explain the crack of the
  Gorge and similar chasms beneath the surface."</p>

  <p><span class="dcap">S</span>OME of the most notable exploits in
  mountain-climbing in the Canadian Rockies have been by officers
  of the Dominion Government, such as J. J. McArthur and A. O.
  Wheeler, merely as incidents to their serious work of
  topographical surveying. The advent of the mountaineer as such,
  and the development of the region as a mountaineer's paradise,
  dates from the visit of William Spotswood Green in 1888. Probably
  his book, which appeared two years later, did as much as anything
  else to bring others to the Canadian mountains. At any rate, in
  1890, members of the English and Swiss Alpine Clubs, and the
  Appalachian Mountain Club of Boston, visited the Selkirks, and
  returned with enthusiastic accounts of the new field available to
  mountain climbers.</p>

  <p>The visit of Professor Charles E. Fay, of the Appalachian
  Club, led to the formation of an <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> Alpine section of
  that club, and later to the organisation of the American Alpine
  Club. The Alpine Club of Canada came into being in 1906, and
  since that date, under the notable leadership of A. O. Wheeler,
  has rapidly gained strength and influence, drawing into its fold
  an ever-increasing number of those who find keen pleasure and a
  widening and strengthening of all their faculties in the splendid
  sport of mountain-climbing, or in the mere dwelling from day to
  day in the companionship of some of the most noble works of
  Nature.</p>

  <p>The earlier explorations of mountain-climbers, following that
  of Green, were confined pretty well to the Selkirks, but as
  interest spread the great peaks of the main range were attempted,
  and one after another succumbed to the attacks of such notable
  climbers as Outram, Fay and Parker; Collie, Stutfield and
  Woolley; Abbott, Eggers, Weed and Thompson, and the prince of all
  mountain-climbers, Whymper. A brief account will now be given of
  some of these ascents in the Rockies, leaving the Selkirks to
  another chapter.</p>

  <p>Dr. Fay made an attempt upon Mount Goodsir in 1901, with
  Outram and Scattergood, and the veteran Swiss guide Christian
  H&auml;sler, but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id=
  "Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span> owing to the exceptionally
  dangerous condition of the snow near the summit the party were
  forced to turn back at the foot of the final peak. Two years
  later this superb peak of the Ottertail Range was again attacked
  by Dr. Fay, accompanied this time by Professor Parker, and the
  guides Christian Kaufmann and H&auml;sler. Dr. Fay has described
  both climbs in the <i>Canadian Alpine Journal</i>, 1907, from
  which the following account is taken.</p>

  <p>The party camped at the foot of the mountain, in 1901, and set
  out at daybreak the following morning. A stiff climb brought them
  to the base of a steep cliff beyond which rose the final peak.
  "Before us," says Dr. Fay, "rose this beetling face of dark rock,
  with little snow patches here and there revealing possible
  stations, between which only cracks and slight protuberances
  offered scanty holds for foot and hand." With great care,
  however, they finally reached the top of the cliff. Here,
  however, they were brought to a standstill.</p>

  <p>"A most ominous situation revealed itself. The final peak was
  before us, and its summit hardly three hundred feet
  distant&mdash;a great white hissing mass,&mdash;a precipice on
  the hidden left side, a steep snow-slope of perhaps 65 to 70
  degrees on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id=
  "Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> the right. Under the July sun its
  whole surface was seemingly in a state of flux, slipping over the
  underlying mass with a constant, threatening hiss. A second
  narrow ar&ecirc;te led across to this final summit. This, too,
  was corniced, and in a remarkable way. The swirl of the wind had
  produced an unusual spectacle. At the beginning and at the end,
  the cornice hung out to the right; in the middle, a reversed
  section of it overhung the abyss on the left.</p>

  <p>"The two similar ones could doubtless have been passed. To
  cross the middle section meant trusting ourselves to the
  sun-beaten slope already in avalanching condition. Indeed, while
  we studied it, and as if to furnish the final argument to our
  debate, the snow on our right impinging against the cornice broke
  away, and down went a well-developed avalanche a couple of
  thousand feet over that much-tilted surface, and vanished in a
  sheer plunge that landed it perhaps three thousand feet below
  that. It was a suggestive and persuasive sight. Feeling sure that
  we had seen enough for one day we beat a careful retreat."</p>

  <p>The 1903 climb was practically identical with that of 1901,
  but the conditions were entirely different. "The broken
  ar&ecirc;te was indeed under a <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> draping of recent
  snow, but no cornice was in evidence. It was 'plain
  sailing'&mdash;and yet very interesting, for the ar&ecirc;te was
  so narrow and thin that one astride it could have his left leg
  vertical over a sheer drop, at first indeed overhanging, of
  hundreds if not thousands of feet, while its mate pointed down
  that 76&deg; slope of snow, as silent now as it was noisy in
  1901. At eleven o'clock we were on the summit&mdash;Goodsir was
  ours. The repulse of two years ago was forgotten, and our
  affections went out to the graceful peak, no longer a sullen
  monster, and, for the joys of that one glorious hour spent on its
  pure snowy summit, we granted it our love for a lifetime."</p>

  <p>The same year Professor Parker, with the guides Christian and
  Hans Kaufmann, made a successful attack on Mount Hungabee, the
  grim "Chieftain" (as the Indian name is translated) that stands
  guard at the head of Paradise Valley.</p>

  <p>The party left the Chalet at Lake Louise on the morning of
  July 20th, and travelling up the Valley of the Ten Peaks, crossed
  over by a high pass into Prospectors Valley where they camped.
  The following morning at 3.50 they left camp and tramped up the
  valley to the foot of Hungabee. A steep slope brought them to the
  foot of a vertical cliff, the only practical means of ascent
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg
  142]</a></span> being by way of a narrow chimney filled with ice.
  Christian Kaufmann went ahead, leaving his companions at the foot
  of the cliff until he should reach the top.</p>

  <p>"It was only," says Professor Parker, "by watching the rope
  that Hans and I could judge the progress Christian was making
  above us. For minutes at a time, it seemed, the rope would be
  motionless, then inch by inch it would slowly disappear up the
  chimney, and the crash of falling rocks and ice would warn us
  that we must cling even more closely and find what protection we
  could beneath the rocky wall." At last Christian gave the signal
  to follow, and the others soon stood beside him at the top of the
  chimney. Above them a smooth, steep slope led to the final peak,
  over which they made their way without difficulty. The summit was
  now only a few hundred feet above, but the ar&ecirc;te or ridge
  leading to it was broken by vertical cliffs and quite unscalable.
  The only alternative was to traverse a tremendously steep
  snow-slope at the base of the cliffs and so reach the final
  cone.</p>

  <p>"We did not," says Professor Parker, "discuss the possible
  dangers of such a course, but cautiously made our way beneath the
  cliffs, turned a most sensational corner almost in mid-air above
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg
  143]</a></span> Paradise Valley, and then scaled a nearly
  perpendicular cliff by means of a convenient crack. We were now
  on the ar&ecirc;te but a very short distance from the summit.
  Only one more difficulty confronted us: a narrow 'gabel,' or
  break in the ar&ecirc;te, only a few feet in width it is true,
  but with a nearly sheer descent of thousands of feet on either
  side. This gabel must be crossed to reach the summit. The
  ar&ecirc;te was far too narrow to allow a jump being made with
  safety; so, slowly and carefully, while firmly grasping the rock
  on one side, Christian thrust his feet forward until they touched
  the other and his body bridged the chasm; then a strong forward
  swing, and he stood safely beyond the gap. For me, aided by the
  rope, the matter was far less difficult, and soon we made our way
  over the intervening ar&ecirc;te, gained the corniced summit, and
  Hungabee, the grim old 'Chieftain,' at last was conquered."</p>

  <p>Among many daring climbs in the Canadian Rockies, few have
  been more sensational than the successful ascent of Pinnacle
  Mountain, on the eastern side of Paradise Valley, by J. W. A.
  Hickson in 1909. The following is borrowed from Mr. Hickson's
  spirited account of the climb in the <i>Canadian Alpine
  Journal</i>, 1910. Several determined efforts had been made to
  capture the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id=
  "Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> peak during the summer of 1907,
  but the season was unfavourable for mountaineering, and in every
  case the climbers were driven back. The critical point was at the
  foot of an almost vertical tower, a few hundred feet below the
  summit, but only two possible means of surmounting this final
  wall presented themselves. One was by way of a chimney or crack
  in the wall, and the other in traversing the face of the mountain
  along an extremely narrow ledge of peculiarly rotten rock. The
  first had been tried unsuccessfully in 1907. The latter formed
  the route of the 1909 expedition. Mr. Hickson was accompanied by
  two Swiss guides, Edouard Fuez, Jr., and Rudolf Aemmer.</p>

  <p>"It was realised," says Mr. Hickson, "that only very slow
  progress could be made in this direction, for the disintegrated
  tawny-coloured limestone rock was of a most treacherous
  character. It was covered for the most part with a glaze of ice,
  which when disturbed had a tendency to bring the eroded limestone
  away with it. It was hard to say whether the rock sustained the
  ice or vice versa; perhaps the support, such as it was, was
  mutual.</p>

  what seemed more like half an hour&mdash;astride a rocky
  protuberance, which appeared likely to give way at any moment,
  while Fuez was endeavouring to find a good footing on the other

  many places there were no handholds; and we dared not touch the
  rocks with our ice-axes lest we should precipitate downwards the
  insecure supports we were standing on. We were very much in the

  leave us hanging precariously, Fuez picked out places here and
  there which offered the chance of a support, and we were glad
  when we found a piece of rock an inch or two wide and a few
  inches long on a part of which a nailed boot-edge could obtain a
  transitory grip. It is remarkable how very small a projection, if
  not slippery, will suffice for a temporary hold. Fortunately not
  one of the party once slipped; thus avoiding any test as to how
  far he could have been held by the others. Luckily, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
  also, we had lots of rope, so that we could allow about
  twenty-five feet between each person, and thus enabled us at
  times to man&oelig;uvre into better positions.</p>

  <p>"Our nerves throughout this period of two hours, during most
  of which only one of us moved at a time, were at considerable
  tension; not a moment of slackness or diminution of watchfulness
  being allowable. A keen lookout was constantly demanded to meet
  an emergency which was not at all improbable. Nothing could be
  taken or was taken for granted, except that everything was
  unreliable and an accident might be expected. This is perhaps why
  none occurred.</p>

  <p>"After advancing persistently and almost horizontally along
  the face of the wall for two hours, we saw an unexpected chance
  of reaching our goal more speedily than we had latterly hoped.
  This was offered by a large couloir leading to the 'saddle'
  between the black tower and the summit of the mountain, which is
  not much higher than the top of the tower. Fairly steep and
  broad, the gulch contained some ice and snow.</p>

  <p>"As we got down into it Fuez turned to me and said, 'I think
  we've got him,' of which I was already convinced. Crossing the
  couloir we rapidly ascended the rocks on the left side and at its
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg
  147]</a></span> top, to our great surprise, landed on a bed of
  shale, which by an easy slope led in a few minutes to the
  summit."</p>

  <p>After resting for a time on the summit, and enjoying the
  wonderful panorama of peaks and valleys, they prepared to make
  the descent. It being more trying and precarious to climb down
  than up a mountain, the guides were unwilling to follow the
  rather hazardous route they had taken on the way to the summit,
  if it could be avoided, and it was therefore decided to attempt
  the chimney, on the other side of the mountain.</p>

  <p>"We followed a narrow but firm ledge for about fifteen minutes
  from the saddle around the southerly tower. It then became
  necessary to reconnoitre to see if the route proposed were
  further feasible. So the second guide Aemmer, assisted by Fuez,
  went ahead and soon returned to say that we could get down by
  roping off. This led to one of the most interesting and exciting
  bits of the whole climb.</p>

  <p>"At the corner or angle where the ledge terminated there was a
  peculiar arrangement of rock which had resulted in the formation
  of a small square hole with nothing but sky to be seen on the
  further side. Under this hole there was a gap in the ledge of
  about three feet, with a drop <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span> of about fifteen
  feet into a dark pit beneath. To cross the gap it was necessary
  to lie down flat upon the ledge on the one side with face to the
  rock, stretch your feet to the rock on the other, your body thus
  spanning the gap, then draw yourself through the hole and
  gradually swing yourself into an upright position by the help of
  the rope and the handholds in the further wall of rock. It looked
  a more trying operation than it actually was because one had to
  turn somewhat sharply on emerging from the hole in order to stand
  on a somewhat slender ledge. But there is practically no danger;
  when one is firmly held on the rope by guides, whose caution and
  resourcefulness, here as elsewhere, were admirable, and have
  fully justified the confidence which I have always reposed in
  their ability.</p>

  <p>"Having, with mutual assistance, all three surmounted this
  difficulty and having advanced a little further down the side of
  the tower, we perceived a way into the chimney already referred
  to, about sixty feet above its base. Here it was obvious that the
  only way of getting down was to rope off. Amongst other
  paraphernalia we had brought with us an extra short piece of rope
  which would serve as a loop. It was now slung around a firm piece
  of rock, which was rendered <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span> more adaptable to
  the purpose by a little hammering, while through the loop was
  passed a second rope about 120 feet long. This being doubled
  still gave us the required length.</p>

  <p>"I went down first, being held besides on another rope, so
  that no serious mishap could have overtaken me. For the first
  forty feet there were practically no footholds to be found, a
  fact for which we were prepared; but fortunately the rock was
  good&mdash;indeed, this is the only bit of firm rock on the
  mountain&mdash;and I got safely down and out of the chimney,
  after swinging once or twice like a bundle of goods, without any
  worse experience than having my clothing a little torn and with
  the feeling that there might be a permanent groove around the
  centre of my body.</p>

  <p>"Fuez descended next and took a photograph of Aemmer sitting
  at the top. As Aemmer was descending he disturbed a small stone
  which danced down with great force and, to Fuez's chagrin, cut
  off about twenty feet from the lower end of his fine manilla
  rope. We then pulled down the rope, but of course, had to leave
  behind the loop, which may be serviceable to some other
  party."</p>

  <p>One is tempted to repeat the story of the first <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
  successful ascent of Mount Deltaform, described by Wilcox as the
  "most difficult mountain yet ascended in the Canadian Rockies;"
  and of Wilcox's own climb up Mount Temple, but both are readily
  accessible in the <i>Rockies of Canada</i>. Some idea of the
  magnitude of the task of scaling Deltaform may be got from the
  fact that an unusually strong climbing party consisting of
  Professor H. C. Parker, Dr. A. Eggers, and the Swiss guides Hans
  and Christian Kaufmann, were nearly twenty-two hours in
  conquering the peak, "after a reconnaissance and repulse two days
  before."</p>

  <p>This sketch of mountain-climbing in the main range of the
  Canadian Rockies, designed merely to give as far as possible in
  the words of the actors, some idea of the experiences incident to
  this king of sports, may close with an account of the first
  ascent of Crows Nest Mountain, one of the most difficult climbs
  in the Southern Canadian Rockies. P. D. McTavish tells the story
  in the <i>Canadian Alpine Journal</i>, 1907.</p>

  <p>In August, 1905, Mr. McTavish, with three friends, reached the
  base of the mountain and after several attempts which ended in
  quite impossible precipices, found a great crevice leading up
  about 400 feet and "resembling the space left <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> in
  a whole cheese when a thin wedge-shaped piece has been removed."
  After resting for a time, they climbed up to a dome of rock which
  had obstructed their view. "With some difficulty we surmounted
  this, and found ourselves at the base of a beautifully straight,
  but very perpendicular, chimney, about six feet in width and two
  hundred feet high. This offered possibilities, so we immediately
  proceeded to climb to the top. Arriving there, a short shaly
  slope led to a similar chimney, up which we climbed. We now found
  ourselves at the top of the first circular band which begirts the
  mountain, and felt that victory was within our grasp.</p>

  <p>"For some time we encountered a series of steep, rocky slopes
  and perpendicular faces, which led to a long slope of about one
  thousand feet, after which the climbing again became fairly
  difficult, but for only a short time, as we had reached the final
  dome, and at 12.15 o'clock we stood upon the summit." The entire
  climb had occupied about four hours.</p>

  <p><span class="dcap">A</span>LTHOUGH W. S. Green had made an
  attempt in 1888, it was not until two years later that the giant
  of the Selkirks, Mount Sir Donald, was conquered. In July, 1890,
  Carl Sulzer and Emil Huber, of the Swiss Alpine Club, set out one
  morning about 4 o'clock from their camp at timber line,
  determined to find a way to the summit of the magnificent peak
  that shot up into the sky from their very feet. They had already
  studied the mountain from several points, and had selected a
  route that looked promising.</p>

  <p>Crossing a small glacier, they turned up a couloir or gully
  terminating in a cave, above which the cliffs rose almost
  perpendicularly. The last part of the couloir became so narrow
  that the climbers had to force their way up by propping their
  bodies in the angle against the rocks on either side.</p>

  <p>After a short rest, they started climbing up to <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
  the rocks of the southern ridge. It was stiff work in places even
  for such experienced mountaineers, but finally they reached the
  main crest and "gazed beyond the undulating tops of the
  foothills, upon the far-stretched row of blue peaks of the Rocky
  Mountains." Following the ar&ecirc;te, or steep ridge of the
  mountain, and overcoming more than one difficulty as they went,
  they finally stood upon the summit, 10,800 feet above the
  sea.</p>

  <p>From this isolated point they had a wonderful view of the
  Selkirks, with the main range of the Rockies in the distance.
  "The finest view presented itself in the southwest and south.
  Above the undulations of the Asulkan and Illecillewaet glaciers
  and opposite a deep valley, the fine group of Mount Dawson arose
  with its two corner-pillars, Mount Donkin and Mount Fox. But the
  most beautiful mountain of all appeared above the opening between
  Mount Dawson and Mount Donkin. It was Mount Purity, very properly
  so called, a snow mountain of the finest order."</p>

  <p>Building a cairn to commemorate the first ascent of Sir
  Donald, and burying in it a bottle containing a record of the
  climb, ending with the jubilant words, "Three cheers for
  Switzerland," they retraced their way down the mountain, and were
  enthusiastically received at Glacier House, <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
  news of the first big climb in the Selkirks being immediately
  telegraphed east and west.</p>

  <p>Toward the end of the same month, Herr Huber, accompanied by
  Messrs. Topham and Forster, of the English Alpine Club, made the
  first ascent of Mount Purity, which had been named by Topham.
  They camped on the western slopes of the mountain, and set out
  for the summit about sunrise the following morning. The climb was
  a comparatively easy one to such seasoned mountaineers, and two
  hours' work brought the party to the summit.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile Herr Sulzer was attacking another virgin peak, which
  he had named Swiss Peak. He had but one companion, with little or
  no experience in mountain-climbing, so that the attempt was a
  somewhat daring one.</p>

  <p>Clambering up a series of grassy slopes and rock ridges, and
  crossing a glacier, they encountered steep rocks which afforded
  interesting though cautious climbing. A steep ice-slope now
  blocked further progress, and had to be negotiated by cutting
  "deep steps into the blue ice, which was as hard as glass." An
  hour's hard work brought them to the rocks on the opposite side.
  A comparatively easy climb along the ridge finally conducted them
  to the summit. <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id=

  <p>"The day," says Sulzer, "was perfectly clear. As far as the
  eye could see were innumerable mountain peaks all around. In the
  southern foreground the ice-girdled, central mass of the
  Selkirks, with its northern marking stone, the bold, fascinating
  Sir Donald, appeared especially beautiful. In the east, beyond
  the lower Selkirk peaks, the long row of haughty Rockies lay
  spread in partly rounded, partly broken shapes&mdash;a scene
  which I shall never forget. Sharply outlined, dark rock masses
  interchanged with lofty snow-tops; all showed clearly and
  glistened in the furthest distance, where, only fading, their
  faint outlines were lost in the horizon. The northern groups
  showed some particularly high peaks, and immense snow and
  ice-fields. Stately mountain chains in the west completed the
  scope." Herr Sulzer supposed the high peaks in the north to be
  Mount Brown and Mount Hooker, the famous peaks near the
  headwaters of the Athabaska which David Douglas the botanist
  estimated in 1827 to be between 16,000 and 17,000 feet in height,
  and which Professor A. P. Coleman of Toronto visited in 1893 and
  found to be about 9000 feet! In 1890, of course, they were still
  supposed to be the highest peaks in the Canadian Rockies, and
  many an ambitious mountain-climber <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span> hoped some day to
  stand upon their remote summits.</p>

  <p>As the reputed eminence of these now rather despised mountains
  was universally received for well-nigh three-quarters of a
  century, and is still recorded in a number of very respectable
  books of reference, it may not be without interest to quote
  Douglas's own account, as found in his Journal:</p>

  <p>"Being well rested by one o'clock," (he was then at the summit
  of Athabaska Pass), "I set out with the view of ascending what
  seemed to be the highest peak on the north. Its height does not
  appear to be less than sixteen thousand or seventeen thousand
  feet above the level of the sea. After passing over the lower
  ridge I came to about 1200 feet of by far the most difficult and
  fatiguing walking I have ever experienced, and the utmost care
  was required to tread safely over the crust of snow.</p>

  <p>"The view from the summit is of too awful a cast to afford
  pleasure. Nothing can be seen in every direction as far as the
  eye can reach except mountains towering above each other, rugged
  beyond description.... This peak, the highest yet known in the
  northern continent of America, I feel a sincere pleasure in
  naming <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg
  160]</a></span> 'Mount Brown,' in honour of R. Brown, Esq., the
  illustrious botanist.... A little to the southward is one nearly
  the same height, rising into a sharper point; this I named Mount
  Hooker, in honour of my early patron, the Professor of Botany in
  the University of Glasgow. This mountain, however, I was unable
  to climb."</p>

  <p>Dr. J. Norman Collie, in commenting on this passage, says: "If
  Douglas climbed a seventeen-thousand-feet peak alone on a May
  afternoon, when the snow must have been pretty deep on the
  ground, all one can say is that he must have been an uncommonly
  active person. What, of course, he really did was to ascend the
  Mount Brown of Professor Coleman, which is about nine thousand
  feet high. These two fabulous Titans, therefore, which for nearly
  seventy years have been masquerading as the monarchs of the
  Canadian Rockies, must now be finally deposed."</p>

  <p>In a letter from Mr. A. L. Mumm, of the English Alpine Club,
  who did some climbing in the Canadian Rockies in the autumn of
  1913, he mentions that he climbed Mount Brown, and his aneroid
  made the height 8950 feet. Lest the humiliated mole-hill should
  fade away altogether, he is willing to admit that the accepted
  elevation of 9050 feet is probably correct. As for Mount
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg
  161]</a></span> Hooker, no one seems to have thought it worth
  while to climb it. In fact there is no great certainty as to
  which of the mountains about Athabaska Pass was Douglas' Mount
  Hooker. All that remains certain is that no peak in the
  neighbourhood remotely approaches the height given by the
  well-meaning botanist.</p>

  <p>We may return to Herr Sulzer for a moment to note a curious
  incident that he mentions in connection with an expedition to a
  point west of Mount Tupper. "Seated on the highest elevation," he
  says, "I began to sketch a portion of the view, while black
  thunderclouds sailed towards the ridge from the valley. Suddenly,
  two stone slabs next to me and standing opposite each other begin
  to make a humming noise, the metal holder of my sketching pencil
  buzzes and my pick begins to crackle strongly, especially when I
  grasp it. Simultaneously, a slight rain sets in and my fingers,
  also moistened by the rain, buzz. My companion is taken by a
  sudden fright and is incapable of uttering a sound. The cause of
  this phenomenon was clear to me at once, although I was not fully
  aware of the degree of danger which it might include. We were in
  an electric cloud. I remembered to have heard a few thunder
  reports a short time before, issuing from the same <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
  cloud which had now reached us. The main volume of electricity
  stored up in it had escaped by lightning. The rest escaped when
  it reached the ridge, and to some extent, we ourselves
  involuntarily acted as conductors to the earth. A direct danger,
  therefore, was not present; for if the electric tension had still
  been great enough to generate lightning flashes, such would have
  been ejected before the clouds themselves touched the ridge.
  Nevertheless, the phenomenon was so strong that when I touched
  the pick on its metal mount, I felt a strong shock, and at night
  the play of sparks would undoubtedly have been visible."</p>

  <p>The Minute Book at Glacier House contains an account of the
  first ascent of Mount Tupper, by Wolfgang Koehler, of Leipzig, in
  1906. A translation of the narrative appeared in the <i>Canadian
  Alpine Journal</i>, 1909, from which the following is taken:</p>

  <p>Koehler made the expedition with two Swiss guides, Edouard
  Fuez, Jr., and Gottfried Fuez. They walked from Glacier to Rogers
  Pass, and climbed up the trail to a hut provided for
  mountain-climbers, where they spent the night.</p>

  <p>"The night was wonderfully beautiful, a cloudless sky and
  brilliant moonlight. Moreover, to <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> be surrounded by the
  dear, beautiful mountains! How one's heart goes out to them!
  Towards 4 <span class="smcap">A. M.</span> we got up,
  breakfasted, and started off at 5 <span class="smcap">A.
  M.</span> We took the direction at first immediately behind the
  hut, then turned off to the right, and across the little icy
  creek, looking up to Rogers, Swiss and Fleming Peaks, Mount
  Tupper, Sifton and Grizzly. It was always up and then down again.
  We had innumerable gullies and streams to cross, until we reached
  the ridge at the end of two hours. We rested, and then started
  again, always following the ridge over icy blocks."</p>

  <p>So they made their way, with more or less difficulty, until
  they reached a point where more serious problems confronted them.
  There were several possible routes, all involving pretty stiff
  climbing. One was finally selected as the most promising.</p>

  <p>"In the middle of the right wall was a broad chimney, if only
  we could get up there direct. Two ridges appeared running
  parallel, which seemed to make the ascent possible. We climbed to
  the first ridge, next to the chimney, then up the first ridge in
  the chimney itself. So far we were still right. With the help of
  three picks and four hands Edouard got up a little higher, but
  quickly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id=
  "Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> came down again. That could not be
  the right way. He tried then to go direct by the chimney, but
  that was not practicable, and so he had to come back.</p>

  <p>"In between was Gottfried, who had successfully climbed up and
  stood in the chimney. I followed, Gottfried continued on, but a
  shower of big and small stones came down. It seemed as if
  everything was rotten, and, in spite of great care, not one of us
  could avoid bringing down the stones. We now went on the outside,
  round the rock, and came to a big flat, climbed a little broken
  chimney, and then got over a large rock. Soon we stood again
  before the wall. One piece appeared somewhat loose, and formed a
  breach, which gave us sufficient hold to get on to a small
  platform. From there it was a short, somewhat overhanging climb
  to the higher platform. 'This is the sort of place for people
  with long legs,' Edouard called out (I am 6 ft. 4 in.). 'Alas, we
  little ones have no chance.'</p>

  <p>"We now came back again to the ridge, came to a little
  <i>gendarme</i> (isolated rock tower or pinnacle) with a
  beautiful outlook down the valley, and climbed on, until we
  suddenly came to a wide platform. We had all three expected that
  the last piece to the summit would be especially difficult.
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg

  to it quite an easy way appeared of getting up. We stepped over

  new transcontinental railways, the Grand Trunk Pacific and the
  Canadian Northern, on their way to the Pacific coast. These two
  parks may for convenience be called the Northern Group, although
  only one is strictly speaking a national park, Robson being under
  the jurisdiction of the Provincial Government of British
  Columbia. T&ecirc;te Jaune Pass and T&ecirc;te Jaune Cache are
  said to commemorate the personality of a veteran Indian trader or
  trapper whose yellow hair made him conspicuous in a country where
  black was the prevailing hue. Jasper Park is named after a famous
  trader of the North West Company, <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span> Jasper Hawes, the
  site of whose trading fort may still be seen on the banks of the
  Athabaska, though every vestige of the buildings has long since
  disappeared. Jasper House, as it was called, was still standing
  when Milton and Cheadle went through the mountains in 1862. They
  describe it as "a neat white building, surrounded by a low
  palisade, standing in a perfect garden of wild flowers, backed by
  dark green pines which clustered thickly round the bases of the
  hills." Ten years later, when Sandford Fleming examined the pass
  as a possible route for the Canadian Pacific Railway, the post
  had been abandoned and the buildings were falling into decay. A
  mile or two east of Jasper, the headquarters of the park, one is
  shown a grassy mound which represents all that remains of another
  old trading post, Henry House. Here two routes through the
  mountains forked, one leading up to Yellowhead Pass, and the
  other to Athabaska Pass.</p>

  <p>The peculiar charm of Jasper Park, and of its sister
  reservation on the western side of the Pass, is in the fact that
  it is almost virgin ground. As a Park it is very young indeed,
  and there has not yet been time to improve upon nature. Lest this
  should suggest a touch of sarcasm, let us admit <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span> at
  once that nature can be improved upon when the improvement takes
  the form of practicable trails into the heart of the mountains,
  and the opening of such trails is one of the principal objects of
  the Canadian Parks authorities. Nevertheless, however one may
  appreciate the convenience of a good trail, there is a joy
  unspeakable to the natural man in getting out into the
  wilderness, if possible where no man has been before, but at
  least where nothing exists to remind him of the noisy
  civilisation he has managed to escape from for a time. And that
  is what you will find in Jasper Park: no automobiles, no stage
  coaches, no luxurious hotels, no newspapers, no luxuries of any
  kind, and very few conveniences; but a sufficiency of plain food,
  the intoxicating air of the mountains to eat it in, and the
  mountains themselves ever about and above you. What more could a
  tired man ask? What more could any man ask?</p>

  <p>At least so two eastern city men thought as they awoke one
  glorious August morning to find their train crossing the eastern
  boundary of Jasper Park, with Brul&eacute; Lake sparkling ahead
  and the curious outlines of Folding Mountain dominating the
  landscape to the south. At a little station called Pocahontas, a
  few miles beyond <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id=
  "Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span> the western end of the lake, they
  were dumped off unceremoniously with their luggage, and welcomed
  by a stalwart park officer who had rashly undertaken to look
  after them for the next few days, and particularly to pilot them
  out to the Miette hot springs. While he trotted off to round up
  his ponies, the two "tenderfeet" had leisure to look about
  them.</p>

  <p>Pocahontas, what there is of it, nestles at the foot of Roche
  Miette, a great frowning bastion of rock dropping sheer for
  nearly a thousand feet toward the waters of the Athabaska. They
  tell you in the mountains that it was named after a trapper who
  managed to clamber up its precipitous sides many years ago,
  perhaps in chase of a mountain goat, and sat himself down on the
  extreme edge with his feet dangling over the thousand foot drop.
  No doubt the situation afforded him the same satisfaction that is
  experienced by those praiseworthy citizens whose names one sees
  carved on the extreme end of a log overhanging the Horseshoe
  Falls at Niagara. Posterity has rather a rude name for such
  heroes.</p>

  <p>A short walk from Pocahontas brings you to a view of one of
  the most charming waterfalls in this part of the mountains. The
  erosion of ages has here carved out of the face of the cliff a
  lofty, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg
  173]</a></span> semi-circular alcove, and over this background of
  sombre rock drops a ribbon of sparkling diamonds. An illustration
  might give some idea of the scene, but could not do justice to
  the peculiar grace and animation of the fall as seen under a
  bright sun and swayed gently by a summer's breeze. There are a
  number of beautiful waterfalls in Jasper Park, such as those on
  Stony River, a tributary of the Athabaska some distance above
  Pocahontas, in the Maligne Canyon, of which something will be
  said later, on the south side of Pyramid Mountain, and on Sulphur
  Creek above the hot springs, but none that cling to the memory
  like that of the Punch Bowl.</p>

  <p>Largely because the Southern Parks, Rocky Mountains, Yoho and
  Glacier, are comparatively well known, the writer has preferred
  to describe them impersonally, to picture them as far as possible
  as seen through the eyes of other and more competent authorities,
  men who have learnt to know them intimately. The case is
  different with the Northern Parks, Jasper and Robson. Very few
  visitors from the outside world have yet discovered their
  wonderful possibilities; indeed until very lately they have been
  inaccessible except to those possessing the time and hardihood
  for a long journey from Edmonton over very rough trails.
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg
  174]</a></span> Similarly very little has been written about the
  Northern Parks. For this reason the writer will venture to
  describe in a more personal vein some of the characteristic
  features of Jasper and Robson.</p>

  <p>Presently the ponies arrived, and we set off on our
  fourteen-mile ride to the Miette springs. The trail was a good
  one, so that we were not yet in the full enjoyment of the
  wilderness. That was to come later. Mile after mile we jogged
  along, sometimes in the open, sometimes in the heart of the
  woods, winding zigzag fashion down a steep hillside, splashing
  through a noisy little creek, and zigzagging up the opposite
  hill. For a couple of hours Roche Miette towered above us as we
  swung around his flank, and then ahead loomed up the great wall
  of Buttress Mountain, with Fiddle Creek winding along its base,
  peacefully enough now, so peacefully indeed that it is hard to
  believe the tales we are told of its resistless fury as it rages
  down in the spring, filling this wide channel from bank to bank,
  and turning its wonderful canyon&mdash;200 feet of sheer black
  rock&mdash;into a roaring hell of waters.</p>

  <p>The Springs themselves we did not find particularly
  interesting. We listened respectfully to the information that
  their temperature ranged <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175"
  id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> from 112 to 128 degrees
  Fahrenheit, and that they possessed valuable curative properties.
  After testing the upper pool we were willing to believe that the
  temperature was even worse than that, and not being rheumatic we
  accepted the curative properties without question but without
  enthusiasm. Still it was a pleasant enough place to loaf for a
  day or two, scrambling about the hills and exploring the upper
  waters of Sulphur Creek, and the lower pool turned out to be
  rather an agreeable thing to roll about in for a time before
  turning in to our tent for the night. The big mountains, however,
  were still ahead of us, and we saw the last of the little group
  of springs without much regret. Within a year or two the
  primitive pools that have cured the rheumatism and other ailments
  of generations of traders and trappers for a hundred years or
  more, will be confined in neat concrete basins, and a pipe line
  will carry the water down the valley of Fiddle Creek to the
  Ch&acirc;teau Miette, one of a series of great hotels that the
  Grand Trunk Pacific Railway is to build through the mountains.
  Never mind, the tourists are welcome to the Miette Hot Springs,
  and they may build an automobile road along the face of Buttress
  Mountain if they will, so that they leave us for a time
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg
  176]</a></span> unspoiled some of the wild spots that lie
  beyond.</p>

  <p>We started back to Pocahontas rather late in the afternoon,
  and the sun went down as we climbed the last hill from Fiddle
  Creek. Over the shoulder of Buttress Mountain a graceful spire
  soared into the sky, and as we turned in our saddles to take a
  last look at it before following the trail into the woods, it
  grew so strangely and wonderfully luminous that we unconsciously
  pulled in our horses and stood there in silent amazement.
  Momentarily the light deepened, and golden shafts shot out into
  the velvet sky. Then as we gazed spell-bound, from the very heart
  of the golden crown, and immediately behind the glowing peak,
  there rose the silver moon, and hovered for an instant on the
  very summit of the mountain, a vision so glorious that it almost
  brought tears to one's eyes.</p>

  <p>An hour's ride by rail from Pocahontas carried us to Jasper,
  the headquarters of the park administration, a rudimentary town
  seated in a charming valley and surrounded by mountains, with the
  Athabaska sweeping by on its way down to the plains. From here we
  made several short trips, to Pyramid Lake and Pyramid Mountain,
  the former a characteristically beautiful tarn, and the latter a
  graceful peak with a variety <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span> of colouring rarely
  found in these mountains, reds and browns, blacks and greys,
  softly blended with the utmost perfection. On the way we had
  glimpses of a couple of lovely little lakes on the other side of
  the Athabaska, lying close together, one a bright blue and the
  other a most brilliant emerald. Behind them rose Maligne
  Mountain, with the valley of the Athabaska opening up to the
  southwest, a group of great peaks in the distance, and around to
  the west the majestic, snow-crowned peak, Mount Geikie.</p>

  <p>Another day was spent in a long walk to the Maligne Canyon. We
  started under heavy clouds, which presently broke in rain, that
  slow, persistent sort of rain that never seems to tire. On we
  plodded for hours, determined to stick it out because we had been
  warned that we would certainly be driven back. And in the end we
  were rewarded with the Canyon, seen under most uncomfortable and
  depressing conditions, but compelling admiration for its gloomy
  splendour, its ebony walls so close together in spots that one
  could almost jump across, not merely perpendicular but sometimes
  overhanging, so that creeping to the edge and leaning over one
  looked down to the centre of the stream roaring a hundred feet or
  more below.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg

  <p>One other afternoon was devoted to a visit to Swift, the first
  and only settler in the pass. Swift came here many years ago,
  after an adventurous career in mining camps from Colorado to
  northern British Columbia. On a hunting or trading expedition
  through the mountains he discovered a beautiful little prairie, a
  few miles below where Jasper now stands, and then and there
  determined to make it his home. He came back, built a rude log
  shack, took unto himself a wife, and despite innumerable
  discouragements has managed to live happily and contentedly.
  Today he owns a good farm in the heart of the Rocky Mountains,
  with cattle and horses, and as both the great transcontinental
  railways have had to build through his property, Swift bids fair
  to end his days in wealth and prosperity. If wealth can make him
  any happier, he thoroughly deserves it for his pluck and
  perseverance under conditions that would have driven most men to
  despair. An afternoon spent at Swift's ranch, roaming with him
  about his own particular little canyon, or listening to his yarns
  of mountain and plain, mining camp, trapping, and hunting, told
  with all the spirit of a born story-teller, is an experience well
  worth remembering.</p>

  <p><span class="dcap">C</span>HATTING one evening with the genial
  Superintendent of Jasper Park, into whose sympathetic ear we had
  been pouring our ardent desire to see some portion of the
  mountains that was at least comparatively unknown, he replied: "I
  know the very place you want&mdash;Maligne Lake, off to the south
  of here. I can get you a good guide and outfit to-night, and you
  can start in the morning." The name did not sound very inviting;
  rather suggested that some one had seen the lake and condemned
  it. It appeared, however, that the name was really given to the
  river by which the waters of the lake are carried down to the
  Athabaska, and that the Indians had their own good reasons for
  pronouncing it "bad." We lived to commend their verdict. As for
  the lake, it would be as reasonable to call it "Maligne" as to
  give such a name to a choice corner of paradise. That, however,
  is getting a little ahead of the story.</p>

  <p>The following morning the guide and his <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
  helper with the outfit were waiting for us on the other side of
  the Athabaska. We and our packs were punted across, the
  pack-horses were loaded, we climbed on our ponies and started off
  for the undiscovered country, as it pleased us to call it, with
  mountains smiling down upon us, a radiant sky overhead, and
  unutterable joy in our hearts.</p>

  <p>The trail&mdash;it is painful to admit that there was a trail,
  and an excellent one at that&mdash;led up the valley of the
  Athabaska to Buffalo Prairie, where we made our first camp after
  an easy day's journey. Buffalo Prairie is a beautiful meadow set
  among the rolling hills that break the level of the long valley,
  with that first consideration to those who travel in the
  mountains, an abundance of feed for the horses, and with
  wonderful views of the great guardian peaks, Geikie, Hardisty,
  the Three Sisters, and a great company of glittering giants as
  yet unnamed. To one who comes from the east where every little
  hillock has its name, it is startling to find oneself gazing
  reverently at a majestic pyramid of rock and ice soaring a mile
  or so into the sky, and learn from the indifferent guide that it
  is merely one of the thousand nameless mountains.</p>

  <p>The following morning we were off early, to the infinite
  disgust of the horses who were revelling <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span> in
  the good feed of the prairie. There was a long day's journey
  ahead up to and over Bighorn Pass, and a good deal of uncertainty
  as to where we might find any sort of a camping ground on the
  other side of the mountains. For a time we continued our way up
  the valley of the Athabaska, and then began the long slow climb
  up to the pass, over 8000 feet above the sea. As we topped one
  hill after another, sometimes travelling through patches of jack
  pine, sometimes up the dry bed of a mountain stream, there opened
  up new and ever more glorious views of the great ranges on either
  side. High up on the trail we had to turn aside to make room for
  a long pack train on its way down to Jasper. Hideous confusion
  would result if the two outfits were allowed to get entangled,
  only to be made right after much expenditure of time and pungent
  language. Finally the last pack-horse went by with a picturesque
  packer jogging along in the rear, and we began the last and
  heaviest grind up to the pass. The trail wound into the pass, and
  up and ever up, until we must get off the plucky little beasts
  and lead them the final stage, puffing and panting as we stumbled
  along through the heavy loose shale until at last we stood on the
  summit, and with a last glance back at the peaks off toward
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg
  184]</a></span> Athabaska Pass turned down through an alpine
  meadow, and in the midst of a swirling snowstorm, toward the
  valley of the Maligne.</p>

  <p>For hours we toiled around the shoulders of hills of loose
  shale, or through miles of muskeg, or fallen timber, sometimes
  mounted, oftener on foot leading our hard-worked ponies, until at
  long last with the sun below the horizon we found on a steep
  hillside a little feed for the horses, and water for our kettles.
  The tent had to be pitched on the trail, the only relatively
  clear spot that could be found, and we trusted to Providence not
  to send another outfit along in the middle of the night to walk
  over us. It had been a long heavy day's travel, and after our
  supper of bannocks and bacon and a pipe we turned in and slept as
  only those may sleep who travel on the wilderness trail.</p>

  <p>Our tent has been spoken of, but it was more properly a
  tepee&mdash;not the tepee that you see in pictures of Indian
  life, made of skins neatly sewn together and perhaps ornamented
  with rude drawings&mdash;but a modern compromise, of the old
  Indian form but made of strong cotton. Some of the guides in the
  mountains much prefer the tepee to the tent in any of its
  familiar forms. Others will have none of it. Our own experience
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg
  185]</a></span> led us to the conclusion that the tepee is
  without a rival in a good tepee country, that is one where
  suitable tepee poles are abundant, but there are occasions when
  you have to camp in a district where poles are as hard to find as
  needles in a haystack, and the resources of the language seem
  ludicrously inadequate as you limp about the camp in an
  ever-widening circle hunting for something that will support the
  thrice-damnable tepee for the night.</p>

  <p>If you are fortunate enough to find a sufficient number of
  long, straight, slender poles among the fallen timber (in the
  parks you are not permitted to cut down trees for the purpose),
  it is a matter of but a very few minutes to stack them in
  position, stretch the cotton over the frame, and lace the front
  with a handful of small twigs, leaving an opening at the top.
  Then you make the beds around the circle, and build your camp
  fire in the middle. On a cold night, and particularly on a cold,
  rainy night, one blesses the Indian who first invented the tepee.
  Instead of shivering outside around a fire that will not burn,
  you have your fire with you in a large roomy tent, and can cook
  your meals and eat them in comfort. And who that has experienced
  it can forget the evening around the tepee fire, resting tired
  bodies on <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id=
  "Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span> luxurious beds, smoking the pipe
  of peace, and swapping yarns until it is time to roll up in the
  thick, warm Hudson Bay blankets and sleep until dawn, or until
  the smell of frying bacon awakens one to another day's
  adventures.</p>

  <p>This morning on the hillside overlooking the Maligne Valley
  proved to be a Red Letter day in our calendar. The sun had been
  rather unkind since we left Jasper, but now as we scrambled out
  of the tepee, we looked up into a cloudless sky. Far below a
  noisy little creek hailed us cheerily as it hurried down from the
  mountains to join the Maligne. In the distance we had glimpses of
  the river itself, and beyond uprose an extraordinary wall of rock
  a thousand feet or more in height, shutting in the valley and
  running on one side toward Maligne Lake and on the other far off
  into the hazy distance toward the Athabaska.</p>

  <p>Our plans were to climb up the valley to Maligne Lake, take
  advantage of the kindly sun to secure a few pictures, and then
  make our way back to last night's camp and down the valley to
  Medicine Lake. East of Medicine Lake we had heard of a wonderful
  little body of water called Jack Lake, famous not so much because
  of its beauty as for the extraordinary abundance of its
  trout.</p>

  <p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg
  187]</a></span></p>

  <p>A ride of an hour or so, up and down hill, through fallen
  timber, muskeg and acres of boulders, with finally a most
  delightful gallop through a piece of virgin timber, brought us
  unexpectedly out on to a point of land overlooking Maligne Lake.
  We had read Mrs. Sch&auml;ffer's enthusiastic description of the
  lake, but were hardly prepared for the perfectly glorious sight
  that lay before us: a lake of the most exquisite blue, mirroring
  on one side a high ridge clothed to the water's edge in dark
  green timber, and on the other a noble range of mountains
  climbing up and up in graceful towers and pinnacles sharply
  outlined against a cloudless sky. Beside us was an ideal camping
  ground, and then and there we vowed to come back to this spot
  some day, with several weeks to the good, and really make the
  acquaintance of Maligne Lake, if one must call anything so
  gracious and beautiful by such an inappropriate name.</p>

  <p>Among the trees by the lake side we caught a glimpse of a
  tent, but the owner was nowhere in sight. We afterwards learned
  that he was one of the forest rangers, who rejoiced in the
  picturesque name of Arizona Pete. How Arizona Pete had wandered
  so far from the land of alkali plains and canyons no one seemed
  to know, but <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id=
  "Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span> it was apparent that he had
  accumulated in his travels a fund of hair-raising stories of
  which Pete was the hero. If one heard of a riotously impossible
  exploit, and it was not attributed to that mythical hero of the
  northwest, Paul Bunion, one knew at once that it must be one of
  the adventures of Arizona Pete.</p>

  <p>Turning our backs most reluctantly on Maligne Lake, we rode
  back to our deserted camp, and north toward Medicine Lake
  following what by courtesy was called a trail but was actually
  nothing but a few blazes pointing the way through a perfect
  wilderness of fallen timber. How the ponies, with all their
  marvellous intelligence and matchless endurance dragged
  themselves and us through the miles of hopelessly tangled logs
  that covered ridge and valley nearly every foot of the way to
  Medicine Lake, none of us could ever understand. However, we did
  at last reach the mouth of the river where it emptied into the
  lake.</p>

  <p>Our proposed camping ground was in sight, a little cove on the
  eastern side of the lake, with feed of sorts for the horses, and
  the prospect of poles for the tepees; but we had still to cross
  the river and the situation looked discouraging. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
  There was said to be a ford here, but the water had risen within
  the last few days and the sagacious ponies sniffed at it
  disapprovingly. We tried one place after another, until finally
  as a last resource the guide mounted the pluckiest and most
  sure-footed of the bunch and coaxed him out into the raging
  stream. Step by step they won their way to the other side, and
  the rest, having seen that the thing could be done, followed
  willingly enough. We all got over with nothing worse than a
  wetting, and the precious provisions escaped even that. Twenty
  minutes brought us to the camping ground, and our troubles were
  over for that day.</p>

  <p>A plunge in the icy waters of Medicine Lake the following
  morning, followed by a hasty breakfast, and we were off for Jack
  Lake eight or ten miles to the east. The guide knew that the
  trail led off from a creek near the camp, but we must hunt for
  the exact spot where it began. It sounds simple enough, but in
  reality it was not at all simple. The trail had not been much
  used, and the creek from which it started ran through a dense
  thicket of alder. There was nothing to do but circle around until
  we found it. So we did, sometimes ploughing through the
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg
  190]</a></span> bush, sometimes splashing up the creek, until at
  last a cry from the guide told us that the elusive trail was
  found, and we could get on our way.</p>

  <p>A few hundred yards brought us to the edge of the timber, and
  we plunged from bright sunlight into the shade of the
  prim&aelig;val forest, where ancient cedars with venerable beards
  rose on every side from a carpet of deep, emerald moss. On we
  jogged for several miles, winding through the forest, now and
  then crossing a clear woodland stream, and climbing gradually up
  into a pass through the mountains. Presently we emerged from the
  trees with bold cliffs rising on either side carved into
  fantastic shapes. We dropped down into a secluded valley, with an
  emerald lake in the centre surrounded by velvet meadows, dark
  green timber beyond stretching up to the foot of white cliffs
  which rose abruptly on every side. Except for an eagle soaring
  far above there was no sign of life in the valley, and the
  silence was so absolute that one unconsciously lowered one's
  voice as if on the threshold of some awe-inspiring temple.</p>

  <p>The trail led down the valley, skirting the shores of the
  lake, wandered through a bit of wood and brought us out on the
  shores of another lake, finally into the timber again, and up out
  of <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg
  191]</a></span> the valley through a gap in the mountains. Then
  for an hour or two we were lost in the forest, following the
  trail as it wound about and about in the seemingly casual and
  aimless fashion of wood trails. It did not appear at the moment
  very important that it should lead anywhere. The air was fragrant
  with the smell of pine and cedar and of a temperature that left
  absolutely nothing to be desired; the great trees were far enough
  apart to afford delightful vistas down long avenues whose mossy
  carpet was kissed by sunbeams filtering through the evergreen
  branches far above; the trail was clear and unencumbered, in
  wonderful contrast to our experience of the previous day; and we
  were quite content to jog along care-free and at peace with the
  world.</p>

  <p>Finally a flash of blue through the trees warned us that we
  were drawing near Jack Lake. We followed its shore for a mile or
  so, or rather climbed along the face of the steep hillside that
  did duty for shore on this side, and rounding the eastern end
  came out on a broad meadow, with a new log shack in the
  foreground, a fringe of trees in the middle distance, and a noble
  range of mountains filling in the background. The owner of the
  shack, a young forest ranger, rushed <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
  out to welcome us with the almost pathetic exuberance of one who
  had not had anybody but his dog to talk to for several weeks.</p>

  <p>When we had satisfied for the time his hunger for news of the
  outside world, we produced our rods and requested him to produce
  his trout. He grinned at the rods, and showed us his own&mdash;a
  stout stick with a heavy cord tied to one end, and at the end of
  the cord a bent horseshoe nail. "The bull trout here," he said,
  "don't like fancy rods." One of us stuck manfully to his
  treasured equipment; the other borrowed the ranger's stick and
  attached to it his heaviest line. Our hooks we learned were much
  too delicate for the purpose, but finally we managed to dig up a
  heavy pike hook for one line and a spoon for the other. With a
  lump of fat pork for bait, we followed the ranger down the banks
  of a creek running out of the lake, until we reached a deep,
  still pool. He pointed silently to the pool, and we gasped. The
  pool was literally alive with big trout from two to four or five
  pounds. The lines barely touched the water before there was a
  fierce rush. The trout were fighting for the bait. A huge fellow
  on each line, a brief struggle, and both were safely landed.
  Within ten minutes we had more than the party could eat in the
  next <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg
  193]</a></span> two or three days, and were throwing back all but
  the largest fish. The climax came when we ran out of pork, and
  one of us half jokingly made a cast with the spoon and no bait,
  and landed a 4-pounder on each naked hook. After that we gave it
  up, and tried the lake, hoping for trout that would give us
  something a little more like sport; but there for some reason or
  other, probably because the water in shore was shallow and we had
  no way of getting out into the lake, we ran to the other extreme,
  and had not a nibble in an hour's fishing. Although the story of
  our experience on the creek is absolutely authentic, we feel
  sadly enough that it is useless to hope that any one who has not
  visited Jack Lake will credit the story. The world is full of
  Doubting Thomases, and fish stories are fish stories.
  Nevertheless, this one is true.</p>

  <p>The following morning we retraced our steps to Medicine Lake,
  and after several hours' most painful scrambling along its
  precipitous banks&mdash;where some enemy had told us there was a
  trail&mdash;we reached its northern end, and camped for the
  night. Maligne Lake and Medicine Lake drain into the Athabaska by
  Maligne River, but at the northern end of the second lake, where
  one would expect to find a considerable stream <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
  flowing out, the shore runs around smoothly to the western side
  without a break. The lake empties through a subterranean channel,
  and reappears in springs some miles down the valley, where the
  Maligne, hitherto a small creek, suddenly develops into a
  respectable river.</p>

  <p>We had been advised to return to the Athabaska by a direct
  trail from Jack Lake, but our evil genius prompted us to try the
  Maligne River route which would bring us out near Jasper. Never
  did the shortest way round prove more conclusively the longest
  way home. For nine long hours we toiled down that interminable
  valley without rest or food, crossing the river back and forth
  innumerable times, scrambling up banks so steep that we had to go
  on hands and knees with our faithful little nags struggling up
  after us, and then finding in disgust that we had to slide down
  again to the rocky bed of the river, worrying through miles of
  fallen timber, miles of muskeg, miles of wiry bushes that slapped
  us viciously in the face as we forced a way through, and ripped
  our clothing until we looked more like stage tramps than fairly
  respectable travellers. The expected trail proved to be nothing
  but a few experimental blazes on the trees; experimental surely,
  as we found more <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id=
  "Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span> than once to our cost, following
  the blazes to a standstill in a blind lead, and turning back in
  our tracks for perhaps half a mile to where the "trail" branched
  off to the other side of the valley. That day we became temporary
  converts to the theory that the pathless wilderness was no place
  for sane mortals.</p>

  <p>However, every lane must have its turning, and at last we
  hailed with shouts of joy the familiar gorge of the Maligne,
  which we had visited from Jasper some time before. From the gorge
  over to the Athabaska we had a good trail, a boat ferried us
  across after our swimming horses, and we were back again at the
  Hotel Fitzhugh, raiding the neighbouring store for tobacco, our
  last pipeful having been smoked two days before. Probably this
  had more than a little to do with our gloomy impressions of the
  Maligne River trail.</p>

  <p><span class="dcap">W</span>AVING a glad farewell to Jasper,
  the ugly little outpost of civilisation, we threw our bags on the
  west-bound train the following morning and were off for Mount
  Robson. A few miles' easy grade and we were at the summit of
  Yellowhead Pass, the continental divide. Behind us was Alberta,
  ahead British Columbia. We had left Jasper Park, and were
  entering Robson Park.</p>

  <p>Sliding down the long slope of the Fraser valley, with the
  blue waters of Yellowhead Lake on our left hand, Mount
  Fitzwilliam above us to the south, and the loftier peak of Geikie
  gradually opening up beyond, we began to realise that there was
  much yet to be seen both at our feet and up in the clouds.
  Another ten or fifteen miles, and we were travelling along the
  north shore of Moose Lake, with the Rainbow Mountains on one side
  and the Selwyn Range on the other. Moose Lake was left behind,
  and we crowded out on to the rear platform of the train
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg
  200]</a></span> to get our first glimpse of the Monarch of the
  Rockies, Mount Robson. Almost without warning it came. We rounded
  the western end of the Rainbow Mountains and looked up the valley
  of the Grand Fork. "My God!" some one whispered. Rising at the
  head of the valley and towering far above all the surrounding
  peaks we saw a vast cone, so perfectly proportioned that one's
  first impression was rather one of wonderful symmetry and beauty
  than of actual height. Then we began to realise the stupendous
  majesty of the mountain, and recalled the words of Milton and
  Cheadle half a century ago, "a giant among giants, immeasurably
  supreme." Now, as then, its upper portion was "dimmed by a
  necklace of light feathery clouds, beyond which its pointed apex
  of ice, glittering in the morning sun, shot up far into the blue
  heaven."</p>

  <p>It is interesting to know that David Douglas was not the only
  scientist who made a wild guess at the height of a Rocky Mountain
  peak. Douglas absurdly over-estimated the elevation of Mount
  Brown and Mount Hooker. Alfred R. C. Selwyn quite as absurdly
  under-estimated the height of Mount Robson, and he was at the
  time Director of the Geological Survey of Canada. Selwyn made an
  expedition to the upper waters <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span> of the Fraser in
  1871, and in his official report says of Robson: "It rises with
  mural precipices to a height of two or three thousand feet above
  the river." As a matter of fact the summit of the peak is about
  ten thousand feet above the river, and something over thirteen
  thousand feet above the sea. There is comfort for the rest of us
  in the fact that such an eminent scientist as the late Dr. Selwyn
  could make such an extraordinary mistake.</p>

  <p>We escaped from the train at a little station named after the
  great mountain, and after several miles' tramp reached the base
  camp of the Alpine Club of Canada, which was then holding its
  annual meeting in the Robson district. There we spent the night,
  and before the sun went down were fortunate enough to get an
  unobstructed view of the peak, the last wisp of cloud driving off
  to the east leaving the mountain outlined from base to summit and
  glowing with unearthly radiance in the light of the setting sun.
  It is only at long intervals that such a view is to be obtained,
  the peak retiring for weeks at a time behind its curtain of
  clouds, or perhaps revealing its vast base and extreme summit
  while the upper slopes are hidden.</p>

  <p>When we set out in the morning for the main <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
  camp of the Alpine Club by the shores of Berg Lake, on the north
  side of the mountain, Robson had vanished completely, so
  completely that a stranger coming here for the first time would
  not know that the impenetrable wall of cloud at the head of the
  valley hid anything more remarkable than the rugged hills on
  either side.</p>

  <p>Our way lay for a time over the level ground covered with
  small timber; then the trail began to climb up the valley, and
  the next eight or ten miles developed into an almost continuous
  ascent, sometimes on easy grades, sometimes winding up the sides
  of a hill as steep as a high-pitched roof. At last beautiful Lake
  Kinney came in sight, with Robson rising in stupendous slopes and
  precipices and buttresses from its shores. Our way lay around the
  north shore of the lake, over a pebbly flat, around the shoulder
  of the mountain and into the Valley of a Thousand Falls&mdash;an
  enchanted valley, and we who had invaded it were nothing but
  dream-folk, wandering spell-bound among scenes more gorgeous than
  those of Sinbad the Sailor. Here was colour in riotous profusion,
  and form, of flower and tree, of sombre cliff and glittering
  snow-field and remote summit, music of mountain stream and
  waterfall, of waterfalls innumerable, and with <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span> it
  all a sublime spirit of rest and peace. What did it matter in
  this Vale of Content that beyond the outer mountains men were
  sweating and struggling for Dead Sea fruit. Here at least one
  could forget for the moment that he was one of the same
  folly-driven race.</p>

  <p>Out of the valley at last we climbed, up and up past the Falls
  of the Pool and the Emperor Falls, up to the shores of Berg Lake
  whose sapphire waters are dotted with white craft launched from
  the eternal snows of the King of Mountains. Here at the end of a
  long day's journey, a journey overflowing with experience, we sat
  down to rest among the tents of the Alpine Climbers. Here, also,
  we listened to the story&mdash;surely one of fine pluck and
  endurance&mdash;of how George Kinney and Donald (popularly known
  as "Curlie") Phillips against all possible odds fought their way
  to the supreme peak of Robson. Let us hear it in their own words
  (<i>Alpine Club Journal</i>, 1910), only premising that this
  first ascent of the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies was made
  in August, 1909, after two unsuccessful attempts in 1907 and
  1908, and that the final ascent was only accomplished after
  twenty days of continuous struggle, during which they were
  repeatedly <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id=
  "Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span> driven back from the peak by
  impossible conditions.</p>

  <p>"At last," says Mr. Kinney, "the weather began to clear up,
  and Monday, August 9th, we again climbed the rugged north
  shoulder. Crossing the difficult shale slope, we passed the camp
  spots of our former trips, and with our heavy fifty-pound packs
  struggled up those fearful cliffs till we reached an altitude of
  nearly ten thousand five hundred feet." Here they ran into a
  blizzard, and after a short, hopeless struggle, had to clamber
  down again to their base camp. Their provisions were almost
  exhausted, and they were many long miles from any possible source
  of supply. For three days it stormed, and they lived on birds and
  marmot. Finally on the 12th it cleared, and they again climbed to
  the top of the west shoulder. "Here, at an altitude equal to that
  of Mount Stephen, we chopped away a couple of feet of snow and
  ice, and feathered our nest with dry slate stones. We shivered
  over the little fire that warmed our stew, and then, amid earth's
  grandest scenes, we went to bed with the sun and shivered through
  a wretched night.</p>

  <p>"Friday, August 13th, dawned cold and clear, but with the
  clouds gathering in the south. Using <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
  our blankets for a wind-brake we made a fire with a handful of
  sticks, and nearly froze as we ate out of the pot of boiling stew
  on the little fire. Then we laid rocks on our blankets so they
  would not blow away, and facing the icy wind from the south,
  started up the west side of the upper part of the peak. The snow
  was in the finest climbing condition, and the rock-work though
  steep offered good going. Rapidly working our way to the south,
  and crossing several ridges, we had reached in an hour the first
  of two long cliffs that formed horizontal ramparts all around the
  peak. We lost half an hour getting up this cliff.</p>

  <p>"The clouds that came up with a strong south wind had
  gradually obscured the peak, till by the time we reached the
  cliff they were swirling by us on our level, and at the top of
  the cliff it began to snow. For a moment I stood silent, and then
  turning to my companion said: 'Curlie! my heart is broken.' For a
  storm on the peak meant avalanches on that fearful slope, and
  there would be no escaping them, so I thought that we would have
  to turn back, and our provisions were now so low that we would
  not have enough to make another two-day trip up the mountain. It
  meant that this was our last <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span> chance; but, to my
  surprise, it did not snow much, the clouds being mostly a dense
  mist. In a few minutes I said, 'Let us make a rush for the little
  peak,' meaning the north edge of the peak which was directly
  above us. 'All right,' said Curlie, from whom I never heard a
  word of discouragement, and away we started, keeping to the hard
  snow slopes. Though these were extremely steep, the snow was in
  such splendid condition that we could just stick our toes in and
  climb right up hand over hand.</p>

  <p>"By the time we had conquered the second of the long ramparts
  of cliffs that form black threads across the white of the peak,
  we concluded that it was not going to snow very hard, as the
  clouds were mostly mist and sleet. Swinging again towards the
  south, we headed directly for the highest point of the mountain,
  which we could see now and then through the clouds. Small
  transverse cliffs of rock were constantly encountered, but they
  were so broken that we could easily get up them by keeping to the
  snow of the little draws.</p>

  <p>"For hours we steadily climbed those dreadful slopes. So
  fearfully steep were they that we climbed for hundreds of feet
  where standing erect in our footholds the surface of the slopes
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg
  207]</a></span> was not more than a foot and a half from our
  faces, while the average angle must have been over sixty degrees.
  There were no places where we could rest. Every few minutes we
  would make footholds in the snow large enough to enable us to
  stand on our heels as well as our toes, or we would distribute
  our weight on toe and hand-holds and rest by lying up against the
  wall of snow. On all the upper climb we did nearly the whole work
  on our toes and hands only. The clouds were a blessing in a way,
  for they shut out the view of the fearful depths below. A single
  slip any time during that day meant a slide to death. At times
  the storm was so thick that we could see but a few yards, and the
  sleet would cut our faces and nearly blind us. Our clothes and
  hair were one frozen mass of snow and ice.</p>

  <p>"When within five hundred feet of the top, we encountered a
  number of cliffs covered with overhanging masses of snow, that
  were almost impossible to negotiate, and the snow at that
  altitude was so dry that it would crumble to powder and offer
  poor footing. We got in several difficult places that were hard
  to overcome, and fought our way up the last cliffs only to find
  an almost insurmountable difficulty. The prevailing winds being
  from the west and south, the <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span> snow driven by the
  fierce gales had built out against the wind in fantastic masses
  of crystal, forming huge cornices all along the crest of the
  peak, that can easily be distinguished from the mouth of the
  Grand Fork some ten miles away. We finally floundered through
  these treacherous masses and stood, at last, on the very summit
  of Mount Robson.</p>

  <p>"I was astonished to find myself looking into a gulf right
  before me. Telling Phillips to anchor himself well, for he was
  still below me, I struck the edge of the snow with the staff of
  my ice axe and it cut in to my very feet, and through that little
  gap that I had made in the cornice, I was looking down a sheer
  wall of precipice that reached to the glacier at the foot of Berg
  Lake, thousands of feet below. I was on a needle peak that rose
  so abruptly that even cornices cannot build out very far on it.
  Baring my head, I said, 'In the name of Almighty God, by whose
  strength I have climbed here, I capture this peak, Mount Robson,
  for my own country and for the Alpine Club of Canada.'"</p>

  <p>The descent was not accomplished without difficulty and

  and frequent detours had to be made to avoid places where the ice
  or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg

  footholds whatever. It took five hours to climb to the summit
  from the camp on the top of the west shoulder, and seven hours to
  return to the same spot. During those twelve hours it was
  impossible either to eat or rest. It was long after dark before
  they reached the base camp, the entire climb occupying twenty
  hours. "We were so tired we could hardly eat or rest and our feet
  were very sore from making toe-holds in the hard snow. But we had
  stood on the crown of Mount Robson, and the struggle had been a
  desperate one. Three times we had made two-day climbs, spending
  ninety-six hours in all above ten thousand feet altitude, so far

  <p>Through the good offices of the Superintendent of Jasper Park,
  we had been fortunate enough to secure the services of Fred
  Stephens to take us through the Moose River country. So much has
  been said about guides, that it may not be amiss to explain, for
  the benefit of those who are not familiar with the Canadian
  Rockies, that there are two quite distinct classes of mountain
  guides, one possessing special knowledge of the high peaks and
  how to get up them, the other knowing like a book the intricate
  wilderness that lies about their feet. The climbing guides are
  Swiss, trained in the Alps. Two or three of them were engaged by
  the Canadian Pacific Railway some years ago, when mountain
  climbers first began to realise the splendid possibilities of the
  country about Laggan, Field and Glacier. The guides spent the
  summer in the Rockies, and returned to Switzerland for the
  winter. Since then the number has steadily increased, and now
  many of the Swiss guides have settled permanently in the Canadian
  Alps, which are now rapidly <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span> becoming popular as
  a winter as well as a summer resort.</p>

  <p>The trail guides are an entirely different class of men. They
  belong to the west, have been trained there, and know its ways.
  Some of them have been trappers or traders, many are hunters, and
  not a few have been cowboys, or miners. All know the mountains
  and the mountain trails, and most of them are good companions
  either in camp or on the trail, quietly competent when work is to
  be done, resourceful in the innumerable emergencies of mountain
  travel, and a fountain of shrewd wisdom and anecdote around the
  camp fire. And of all trail guides in the Canadian Rockies none
  is the superior of Fred Stephens, whether as guide, philosopher
  or comrade. We who had heard his praises sung by others,
  congratulated ourselves when we learned that he was to take us
  through the Moose River country.</p>

  <p>Early next morning we were up and doing. Breakfast was
  despatched, the tents struck, the horses driven in to camp, packs
  made up and securely fastened to the backs of the pack-horses by
  means of the famous diamond hitch, our own ponies saddled, and we
  were off for Moose Pass, waving a reluctant farewell to our hosts
  of the <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg
  216]</a></span> Alpine Club as we trotted through the
  camp&mdash;a tent city gay with bunting, and instinct with the
  wholesome enthusiasm, good-fellowship, and hospitality of the
  mountaineers.</p>

  <p>As we crossed the slight ridge at the foot of Robson Glacier,
  which at this point forms the continental divide, we paused to
  study for a moment the curious family history of two great water
  systems, born in the same glacier. From two blue ice caves in the
  Robson Glacier, one on either side of the ridge of the terminal
  moraine, flow two sparkling streams. One flows southwest into
  Berg Lake, the Grand Fork, the Fraser, and the Pacific Ocean; the
  other flows northeast into Lake Adolphus, the Smoky, Peace River,
  Slave River, Great Slave Lake, the Mackenzie, and the Arctic
  Ocean. Turning our backs on the Berg Lake tributary, after
  wishing it a pleasant journey to the Pacific, we followed its
  brother down to Lake Adolphus and for some miles beyond, when we
  turned east up Calumet Creek toward Moose Pass.</p>

  <p>Near the summit of the pass we found ourselves in the midst of
  one of the most exquisite of Alpine meadows. Imagine a great bowl
  of dark rock relieved here and there with patches of fresh snow,
  and at the foot of this bowl a soft <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>
  emerald carpet, the green almost hidden by glowing patches of
  flowers, asters and arbutus and harebell, purple and white
  heather, lady's tresses and columbine, moss campion, the twin
  flower and the forget-me-not. Think of it, you who treasure a
  little patch of forget-me-nots in your garden, think of walking
  your horse reverently through an acre of forget-me-nots, growing
  so thickly that the blue of them could be seen long before one
  reached the place where they grew, so thickly that one was
  compelled to the sacrilege of treading down thousands of blossoms
  as we crossed the meadow. In honour of the lady of our party,
  whom we believed to be the first white woman to pass this way, we
  named this beautiful spot Merwin Meadow.</p>

  <p>Before we leave the meadow, listen for a moment to a writer
  who combines the imagination of a poet with the exact knowledge
  of a scientist, Dr. A. P. Coleman:</p>

  <p>"If one halts by chance anywhere on a mountain pass, all sorts
  of thrilling things are going on around. Lovely flowers are
  opening eagerly to the sun and wind of Spring&mdash;in
  mid-August, with September's snows just at hand, a whole year's
  work of blossom and seed to be accomplished before the ten
  months' winter sleep begins. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span> Bees are tumbling
  over them intoxicated with honey and the joy of life while it is
  summer. Even the humming-birds, with jewels on their breast as if
  straight from the tropics, are not afraid to skim up the mountain
  sides, poise over a bunch of white heather, and pass with a flash
  from flower to flower. The marmots with aldermanic vests are
  whistling and 'making hay while the sun shines,' and one may see
  their bundles of choice herbs spread on a flat stone to dry,
  while the little striped gophers are busy too. Time enough to
  rest in the winter.</p>

  <p>"Everything full of bustle and haste and of joy, what could be
  more inspiring than the flowery meadows above tree-line when the
  warm sun shines in the six weeks of summer! The full splendour
  and ecstasy of a whole year's life piled into six weeks after
  snow has thawed and before it falls again!</p>

  <p>"Higher up even the snow itself is alive with the red snow
  plant and the black glacier flea, like the rest of the world
  making the most of summer; and as you take your way across the
  snow to the mountain top, what a wonderful world opens out! How
  strangely the world has been built, bed after bed of limestone or
  slate or quartzite, pale grey or pale green or dark red
  <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg
  219]</a></span> or purple, built into cathedrals or castles, or
  crumpled like coloured cloths from the rag-bag, squeezed together
  into arches and troughs, into V's and S's and M's ten miles long
  and two miles high; or else sheets of rock twenty thousand feet
  thick have been sliced into blocks and tilted up to play leapfrog
  with one another.</p>

  <p>"And then the sculpturing that is going on! One is right in
  the midst of the workshop bustle where mountains are being carved
  into pinnacles, magnificent cathedral doors that never open,
  towers that never had a keeper&mdash;all being shaped before
  one's eyes of the mighty beds and blocks of limestone and
  quartzite that were once the sea bottom. You can watch the tools
  at work, the chisel and gouge, the file and the sandpaper. All
  the workmen are hard at it this spring morning in August; the
  quarryman Frost has been busy over night, as you hear from the
  thunder of big blocks quarried from the cliffs across the valley;
  there is a dazzling gleam on the moist, polished rocks which
  Craftsman Glacier has just handed over to the daylight; and you
  can watch how recklessly the waterfall is cutting its way down,
  slicing the great banks of rock with canyons! It is inspiring to
  visit the mountains any day in the year, but especially so in the
  July or <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id=
  "Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span> August springtime, when a fresh
  start is made, and plants, animals, patient glaciers, hustling
  torrents, roaring rivers, shining lakes are all hard at work
  rough-hewing or putting finishing touches on an ever new
  world."</p>

  <p>We tried to keep our minds on such thoughts as these, as we
  left the meadow behind and crossed a ridge of most abominably
  sharp scree, hard on our feet and footwear as we trudged sulkily
  through it, and still harder on the unshod horses who followed
  patiently after. The ridge led to a long slope down the British
  Columbia side of the pass&mdash;for between the foot of Robson
  Glacier and Moose Pass we had crossed a wedge of
  Alberta&mdash;and then mile upon mile of muskeg, where as we
  floundered slowly ahead we alternately admired Fred Stephens'
  unerring skill in following a trail that only became faintly
  visible for a foot or two every three or four hundred yards, and
  damned him heartily for leading us into such a slough of despond.
  However, even the worst muskeg must have an end, and at last we
  and our weary horses pulled out on the other side, trotted
  happily through a bit of virgin forest, and cheered the guide
  when he pointed ahead to our camping ground, an ideal spot in a
  clearing beside the East Branch of the Moose River. <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span> We
  had made twenty miles from Berg Lake, pretty good going in such a
  country, a third of the journey being through heavy muskeg; and
  our second meal that day was at seven in the evening. Fred
  Stephens is without a peer as a guide, but he would never qualify
  as instructor in a cooking school. Nevertheless his bannocks that
  night seemed to us the very food of the gods. It may have been
  because he made them in a gold pan, or it may have been the dry
  humour of his stories, or perhaps it was the fact that breakfast
  seemed so remote that we had forgotten the existence of such a
  meal, but the fact remains that that luncheon-supper of bannocks
  and bacon left us at peace with the world.</p>

  <p>Behind the camp rose an attractive little mountain offering
  some rather interesting rock climbing, and one of us made up his
  mind to have a try at it the following morning before breakfast.
  He managed to get into his clothes without disturbing the rest of
  the party, and pocketing a cold bannock started off for the
  mountain. The first obstacle appeared in the shape of a lively
  branch of the Moose, which had not been noticed the night before.
  A rapid survey up and down stream revealed no means of getting
  across dry, <span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id=
  "Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span> and there was nothing for it but
  to plunge in and wade across. It was waist deep in midstream, and
  the water was not only wet but most exceedingly cold. However,
  there was exercise enough ahead to overcome the chill of the
  reception.</p>

  <p>A long scramble up a slope covered with closely matted bushes
  led at last to the rocks, and the rocks to a series of ledges.
  Being a novice, the climber lost much time in searching for
  practicable routes to the summit, and in an attempt to get up a
  chimney sent down such an avalanche of rock that the camp was
  aroused and began to contemplate a searching expedition for the
  remains of a fool climber. However, fate had some other end in
  view, and the climber went on his way. A steep slope of very
  fine, loose shale ending in a sheer drop of some hundred feet
  finally brought him to a standstill. He had little more than an
  hour to get back to camp, and it would take all of that to find
  another way up to the summit. That little mountain remained
  unconquered. He scrambled down to a draw between the hills,
  crossed a snow patch, swung down a long slope, plunged through
  the uninviting creek, and was back in time to find the party
  packed and ready to march. <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span></p>

  <p>Our way lay down the East Branch, partly over a fairly good
  trail, partly through a repetition of yesterday's muskeg. One of
  the pack-horses took it into his head to do pioneer work in
  opening up new trails through the bush, and was sent in disgrace
  to the rear of the string where the guide's helper could keep a
  watchful eye on him. The helper was a plucky but inexperienced
  little chap, and his limited vocabulary filled the pack-horses
  with contempt. Throughout that day we who were ahead with the
  guide could hear every little while far in the rear the faint
  cry, "Buckskin! Oh, Bu-u-ck-skin!" Finally the cry changed to, "O
  Fred! Pack's off!" and the philosophic guide cantered back to
  bring pack and pack-horse together again. Nothing could possibly
  look more meek and inoffensive than the mild-eyed Buckskin when
  he marched into camp that night, but he had given more trouble
  than the rest of the thirteen horses combined. He probably said
  to himself that he was a horse ahead of his generation, and that
  pioneers were generally misunderstood.</p>

  <p>We camped on the West Branch of the Moose, about a mile above
  its junction with the East Branch, having again made twenty miles
  from our last camp. Once more we camped by the <span class=
  'pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
  river's side, with a fine range of mountains opposite, and a
  splendid view of the Reef Glaciers at the head of the valley.
  Resplendent and Robson were off to the west, but hidden behind
  intervening ridges. We had been hoping all day to see mountain
  goat, but found nothing but a wisp of wool on a bush above a salt
  lick.</p>

  <p>The following morning we started down the Moose, with a
  succession of beautiful views up and down the valley. A deep
  creek which had been roughly bridged with logs gave us some
  trouble. One of the pack-horses&mdash;not the unfortunate
  Buckskin&mdash;went through, and it needed the united exertions
  of four men to get him out. The other horses, who had seen the
  accident and were still on the wrong side of the stream, refused
  to have anything to do with the bridge, and even after we had
  repaired it they were only with the utmost difficulty coaxed
  across one at a time.</p>

  <p>Finally we topped the last ridge, and looked down into the
  valley of the Fraser. The railway track, looking like a thread in
  the distance, seemed utterly unfamiliar after our few days on the
  trail. We had made a wide circle around Robson, starting from
  Robson station, and coming <span class='pagenum'><a name=
  "Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span> back to the railway
  at what was known to the construction gangs as "Mile 17." We had
  supper in Reading's Camp, near the mouth of Grant Brook, and took
  the eastbound train back to Jasper.</p>

  <p>A day or two later we turned our faces toward the east,
  leaving behind more than one friend that we had learned to know
  and appreciate in the simple, human life of trail and camp-fire;
  and carrying with us eternal memories of this region of glorious
  mountains and pine-scented valleys, lakes of turquoise and
  emerald, rushing crystal streams, waterfalls innumerable,
  glaciers and snow-fields, rugged cliffs and green-clad slopes,
  rock-strewn ridges and flower-bedecked meadows, and of the
  marvellously clear and intoxicating air of the mountains lifting
  the soul out of the mire and attuning it to a purer and more
  noble outlook. We had had glimpses of these wonderlands of the
  Canadian West, and we were resolved that another day should see
  our footsteps once more turned toward the beckoning hills.</p>

  <p>To-day, with the "storm-winds of autumn" rushing by from the
  east, we feel like saying, with Matthew Arnold: <span class=

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
